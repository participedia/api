Participants sit in round tables of 10-12 each during the event. Each of these small groups is moderated by a trained facilitator. Additionally, each table has a scribe who records small group deliberations on a laptop. In principle, the small group format enables every participate to engage actively in discussion. Small groups are linked together to create a larger conversation of thousands of people through four devices. First, small groups follows the same agenda of discussion so that conversations run in parallel. Second, the entire session is led by a single host who is a kind of master of ceremonies. Third, each participant is given a wireless keypad. Periodically throughout the event, the host takes straw polls and votes so that the views of all participants can be tallied and displayed. Fourth, each table is assigned a scribe who records table discussions on a laptop computer. Using group-ware, the contents of table conversations are collected in real time and processed by a central “theme team” that attempts to discern the main viewpoints, positions, and themes that emerge at all of the tables. Before the meeting ends, organizers create a report that contains results and recommendations that they distribute to participants, decision-makers, and media. Through this method, organizers aim to create a short term encounter in which participants can learn about complex issues, develop their own views on those issues, and make collective decisions in a deliberative way.</p><p> </p><p><a id=""Principles"" name=""Principles""></a></p><h2>Principles</h2><p>AmericaSpeaks’ work applies a set of core principles to their citizen engagement activities:</p><ul><li>Informed participation through highly accessible materials that frame the issues in a balanced way and provide a baseline of information to begin discussions.</li><li>Facilitated deliberation to ensure all voices can be heard and each participant can play an active role in the deliberations.</li><li>Shared priorities are the endgame, so the process is designed to foster a high level of agreement among participants’ common priorities.</li><li>Link to action is achieved through active involvement from decision-makers and key leaders throughout a project.</li><li>Large scale meetings (500 to 5,000 participants) enable the outcomes to have greater visibility and credibility with policy-makers, the media, key stakeholders, and the public as a whole.</li><li>Sustaining citizen engagement in the policy-making process – through opportunities to take action – develops civic leadership and enhances implementation of public priorities.</li></ul><p> </p><p><a id=""Influence_and_Power"" name=""Influence_and_Power""></a></p><h2>Influence and Power</h2><p>The recommendations that emerge from 21st Century Town Meetings are provided by AmericaSpeaks to decision-makers as advice and a kind of public consultation<a href=""#cite_note-0"" title="""">[1]</a>.</p><p> </p><p><a id=""Examples"" name=""Examples""></a></p><h2>Examples</h2><p><a id=""Secondary_Literature"" name=""Secondary_Literature""></a></p><h2>Secondary Literature</h2><ul><li><a class=""external text"" href=""http://archonfung.net/docs/cases/LtCCaseShort.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""http://archonfung.net/docs/cases/LtCCaseShort.pdf"">Susan Rosegrant, ""Listening to the City: Rebuilding New York’s World Trade Center Site""</a></li><li>Carolyn Lukensmeyer.

"<p><a id=""Definition"" name=""Definition""></a></p><h2>Definition</h2><p>Participatory budgeting is a decision-making process through which citizens deliberate and negotiate over the distribution of public resources.<a href=""#cite_note-wampler-0"" title="""">[1]</a></p><p>Participatory budgeting programs are implemented at the behest of governments, citizens, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and civil society organizations (CSOs) to allow citizens to play a direct role in deciding how and where resources should be spent. These programs create opportunities for engaging, educating, and empowering citizens, which can foster a more vibrant civil society. Participatory budgeting also helps promote transparency, which has the potential to reduce government inefficiencies and corruption. Because most citizens who participate have low incomes and low levels of formal education, participatory budgeting offers citizens from historically excluded groups the opportunity to make choices that will affect how their government acts. Put simply, participatory budgeting programs provide poor and historically excluded citizens with access to important decision-making venues.<a href=""#cite_note-wampler-0"" title="""">[1]</a></p><p><a id=""Process"" name=""Process""></a></p><h2>Process</h2><p>The UK's Participatory Budgeting Unit reports that, as participatory budgeting is quite new, innovative forms of participatory budgeting are being developed all the time and new budgets, new themes, new partners, different areas are demonstrating that participatory budgeting is possible and beneficial for a wide range of services and areas.</p><p>The participatory budgeting process usually requires citizen engagement in the various phases of a budget cycle to identify the capital investments and projects to address the most pressing local needs.</p><p>Participatory budgeting involves citizens, councillors and local government officers working together. Participatory budgeting aims to include those who are not traditionally engaged in policy decisions. As well as citizen involvement, participatory budgeting creates opportunities for greater efficiency in the allocation of public funds and increased community cohesion.</p><p>The main features of participatory budgeting include:</p><ul><li>a geographically defined area such as a local authority, a decentralised district of a local authority, or a defined neighbourhood</li><li>regularly scheduled meetings and debates in each geographical unit</li><li>a cycle of activities closely following the local budgeting cycle</li><li>a network of individuals and organisations involved in training, informing and mobilising local citizen</li></ul><p>There is no universal way of applying participatory budgeting. Methodologies vary from area to area but typically it involves allocating between two to three percent of the annual revenue budgets and sometimes the allocation of new investments. The process involves citizens taking into account both the demand and supply of services and public infrastructure. In the UK, participatory budgeting has mainly been applied to allocating resources for area regeneration and for directing statutory funds to voluntary sector organisations.<a href=""#cite_note-1"" title="""">[2]</a></p><p><a id=""History"" name=""History""></a></p><h2>History</h2><p><a id=""Genesis_in_Porto_Alegre"" name=""Genesis_in_Porto_Alegre""></a></p><h3>Genesis in Porto Alegre</h3><p>Participatory budgeting began in 1989 in the municipality of Porto Alegre, the capital of Brazil’s southernmost state, Rio Grande do Sul (see <a href=""http://participedia.net/cases/participatory-budgeting-porto-alegre"">Porto Alegre Participatory Budgeting</a>). Porto Alegre has more than 1 million inhabitants and is wealthy by Brazilian standards. In 1988 the Workers’ Party, a progressive political party founded during the waning years of the 1964–85 military dictatorship, won the mayoral election. Its campaign was based on democratic participation and the “inversion of spending priorities”—that is, the reversal of a decades-long trend in which public resources were spent in middle- and upper-class neighborhoods. Participatory budgeting was intended to help poorer citizens and neighborhoods receive larger shares of public spending.</p><p>When the Workers’ Party won the mayor’s office in Porto Alegre, it inherited a bankrupt municipality and a disorganized bureaucracy. During its first two years in office, the new administration experimented with different mechanisms to tackle financial constraints, provide citizens with a direct role in the government’s activities, and invert the social spending priorities of previous administrations. Participatory budgeting was born through this experimental process.</p><p>In 1989 and 1990, the first two years of participatory budgeting, fewer than 1,000 citizens participated in the participatory budgeting process; by 1992 the number of participants had jumped to nearly 8,000. After the Workers’ Party was re-elected in 1992, the program took on a life of its own, with participation increasing to more than 20,000 people a year. Participation grew as citizens realized that participatory budgeting was an important decision-making venue.<a href=""#cite_note-wampler-0"" title="""">[1]</a></p><p><a id=""Experimentation_in_Latin_America"" name=""Experimentation_in_Latin_America""></a></p><h3>Experimentation in Latin America</h3><p>Throughout the 1990s, participatory budgeting spread to other municipalities in Brazil and to other countries in South America, including Bolivia, Guatemala, Nicaragua, and Peru.

The design factors were: how formal or informal the process was (ie was it reserved for formal associations to participate or could anyone join in?) and the level of decision-making power of the participants (ie whether the participants debate and decide on spending priorities, how much of the budget is affected by these decisions, and whether authorities respect the decisions). The success criteria were: participation rate, level of expansion/redistribution of services and transparency. Goldfrank concluded that there is ""some support for the assertion that outcomes tend to be better where participatory budgeting is less formalized and more deliberative...where the structures were less formal, participants had more decision-making power, participation rates were higher, policies were more redistributive, and government was more transparent.""<a href=""#cite_note-goldfrank-2"" title="""">[3]</a></p><p>The <a href=""/organizations/european-institute-public-participation"" title=""European Institute for Public Participation"">European Institute for Public Participation</a> is working with the <a href=""/wiki/Participatory_Budgeting_Unit,_Manchester,_UK"" title=""Participatory Budgeting Unit, Manchester, UK"">Participatory Budgeting Unit, Manchester, UK</a> and the UK Government's <a class=""new"" href=""/w/index.php?title=Department_for_Communities_and_Local_Government&action=edit&redlink=1"" title=""Department for Communities and Local Government (page does not exist)"">Department for Communities and Local Government</a> to develop a framework for the evaluation of participatory budgeting, along with other forms of public participation in the UK.</p><p><a id=""References"" name=""References""></a></p><h2>References</h2><ol class=""references""><li id=""cite_note-wampler-0"">↑ <a href=""#cite_ref-wampler_0-0"" title="""">1.0</a> <a href=""#cite_ref-wampler_0-1"" title="""">1.1</a> <a href=""#cite_ref-wampler_0-2"" title="""">1.2</a> Wampler, Brian. 2007. ‘A Guide to Participatory Budgeting’. in Shah, Anwar (ed.).

"<p>Deliberative Polling is a unique form of political consultation that combines techniques of public opinion research and public deliberation to construct hypothetical representations of what public opinion on a particular issue might look like if citizens were given a chance to become more informed. As a polling method, the Deliberative Poll seeks to account for the preferences and opinions of citizens both before and after they have had an opportunity to arrive at considered judgements based on information and exposure to the views of fellow citizens.<a href=""#cite_note-one-0"" title="""">[1]</a> The technique was first developed by Professor James Fishkin of Stanford University in 1988, and has been adopted by local and regional governments across the world – including Canada, the United States, Greece, Italy, Bulgaria, Hungary, the United Kingdom, Brazil and <a class=""external text"" href=""http://participedia.net/wiki/Wenling_City_Deliberative_Poll"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""http://participedia.net/wiki/Wenling_City_Deliberative_Poll"">China</a>.<a href=""#cite_note-two-1"" title="""">[2]</a> In these diverse settings, it has been used as a more accurate means of polling the public, as a method of developing citizen preferences on difficult issues, as a mode of selecting candidates to run in competitive elections, and as a policy tool to direct political officials in public planning efforts.</p><p><a id=""Problems_and_Purpose"" name=""Problems_and_Purpose""></a></p><h2>Problems and Purpose</h2><p>Fishkin initially designed the Deliberative Poll in response to perceived defects of modern public opinion polling methods.<a href=""#cite_note-three-2"" title="""">[3]</a> Fishkin’s main problem was with high levels of citizen-ignorance on many public issues that required substantive background knowledge in order to take an informed position. In these scenarios, citizens have an incentive for ‘rational ignorance’ – that is, they have an incentive to remain ignorant about an issue because the costs (such as time, energy, etc.) of educating themselves outweigh the benefits of doing so. When the incentives for rational ignorance in the general population are high, traditional sample surveys of mass public opinion will often turn up ‘non-attitudes’ or so-called ‘phantom opinions’ on many public questions. This means that ordinary polling techniques will offer, at best, a snapshot of public opinion under conditions where the public has little information, attention, or interest in a given issue.<a href=""#cite_note-four-3"" title="""">[4]</a></p><p>Given the problems for accurate opinion sampling under conditions of rational ignorance, Deliberative Polling is meant to offer a representation of what the public would think about a specific issue under ‘ideal conditions’ – that is, under conditions in which citizens have access to fair and balanced background information, are able to account for the different opinions of fellow citizens, and can interact with expert panels of policy-makers to understand the tradeoffs of different policy positions.<a href=""#cite_note-five-4"" title="""">[5]</a></p><p><a id=""History"" name=""History""></a></p><h2>History</h2><p>Fishkin first proposed the idea of a Deliberative Poll in an article published in Atlantic Monthly in August 1988.<a href=""#cite_note-six-5"" title="""">[6]</a> The article was later developed into a book in 1991 entitled ‘Democracy and Deliberation: New Directions for Democratic Reform'.<a href=""#cite_note-seven-6"" title="""">[7]</a> In both works, Fishkin consistently draws upon two primary inspirations in setting out a viable model for a Deliberative Poll: notions of direct democracy exhibited most prominently in the classical Athenian practice of government; and, the foundational work of George Gallup, whose pioneering work on modern opinion polling still forms the basis of most modern polling practices.</p><p>The first parallel Fishkin draws, is between his Deliberative Polling proposal and the democratic practices of ancient Athens. According to Fishkin, the Deliberative Poll directly appropriated two distinct features of the Athenian model of democracy: first, citizens were selected to participate in Athenian institutions through a lottery, which Deliberative Polling replicates by relying on the method of random selection; and, second, Athenian citizens were typically remunerated for participating, which is a principle that Deliberative Polls also utilize in order to ensure that a more representative microcosm of the public is constructed by encouraging participant heterogeneity.<a href=""#cite_note-eight-7"" title="""">[8]</a></p><p>Fishkin combines the Athenian model for democratic participation with the public opinion polling methods of Gallup. According to Fishkin, Gallup had originally developed public opinion polling with a view to restoring the intimate face-to-face model of democracy of the New England town meeting to the larger state. Figuratively, Gallup had argued that citizens should regularly gather together, make and hear arguments from political leaders to the public, and vote for or against policy proposals directly. In this context, the public opinion poll was seen as completing the political conversation by carrying the public’s views back to political leaders.<a href=""#cite_note-nine-8"" title="""">[9]</a> The problem, however, is that often times respondents to opinion polls are unable to give well thought out answers or informed opinions about an issue – leading to polls becoming an instrument of political elites rather than an empowering democratic procedure. Deliberative Polling, ideally, is supposed to narrow the gap between well-informed and actual public opinion.<a href=""#cite_note-ten-9"" title="""">[10]</a></p><p>The first ever Deliberative Polling experiment was held on April 15, 1994 in Manchester, England. A randomly selected sample of 301 British citizens participated in the event, and over the next two days considered and discussed a range of policy proposals to deal with crime. During the event participants met and deliberated in small group-sessions and then put questions to and heard answers from a panel of experts and representatives of the Conservative, Labour and Liberal Democratic parties. At the end of deliberation day, participants were then asked to once more provide their opinions, which were recorded and later broadcast in a two-hour television special shown on Britain’s ‘Channel 4’. The Poll was viewed as largely successful, with before and after opinion poll results showing that almost half of participants change their initial positions: with near 40 percent adopting a more moderate position, and some 10 to 15 percent switching sides completely.<a href=""#cite_note-eleven-10"" title="""">[11]</a></p><p>As of 2008, there have been more than 50 deliberative polls around the world. Eleven face-to-fact polls have been national – with five of those in Britain (on crime, Britain’s role in Europe, the future of the monarchy, the 1997 general election, and reform of the National Health Service). Other polls have been conducted in Denmark (on the question of adopting the Euro), in Bulgaria (on crime), Australia (one on Australia becoming a republic, and another on Aboriginal reconciliation), and the United States (one foreign policy, the American family, and economic policy, and another on foreign policy in the lead up to the second Iraq war). Thirty-nine of the polls have also occurred at the regional and local level in both the United States and China (notably, in 2005 on participatory budgeting in Wenling City and another similar poll in the same city in 2008).<a href=""#cite_note-twelve-11"" title="""">[12]</a> While most Deliberative Polling experiments have been face-to-face, two successful polls have also been conducted on-line – although they still took place in ‘real time’ and used microphones so that participants could hear their fellow deliberators.<a href=""#cite_note-thirteen-12"" title="""">[13]</a></p><p>Fishkin has registered both ‘Deliberative Poll’ and ‘Deliberative Polling' as trademarks in order to supervise the quality of polling experiments, as well as raise funds for further research and application of the method through the Center for Deliberative Democracy at Stanford University.

The random selection process can occur in either one of two ways: through random digit dialing; or, by sending out ‘warm-up’ letters to a random sample of phone listings and followed up with phone calls. In order to mitigate problems of selection bias, several calls are made to each phone number to ensure that the sample does not just include those easiest to reach (such as retirees). Once contacted, interviewers use several techniques – such as asking for the person with the next birthday – to ensure that the sample also does not bias those who most often answer the household phone (statistically, more often women). Those who agree to participate may receive follow-up phone calls or informational mailing to ensure their commitment. In addition, more targeted phone calls may be made to encourage participation amongst people of demographics less like to the actual polling event (such as those with less education, or those living in remote areas).<a href=""#cite_note-fifteen-14"" title="""">[15]</a></p><p>While there are no ceilings to the maximum number of participants that could be included in a Deliberative Poll, most polling experiments have had between 130 to approximately 450 participants. Participants are also typically paid between 75-200 $US per-day to partake in the deliberation event. While potentially costly to sponsoring organizations, the use of a monetary incentive encourages people of lower socio-economic status to attend, allowing for a more heterogeneous participant pool and a better representative sample of the larger public.<a href=""#cite_note-sixteen-15"" title="""">[16]</a></p><p><a id=""Deliberations.2C_Decisions.2C_and_Public_Interaction"" name=""Deliberations.2C_Decisions.2C_and_Public_Interaction""></a></p><h2>Deliberations, Decisions, and Public Interaction</h2><p>While an ordinary poll is designed to show what the public actually thinks about a set of issues, a Deliberative Poll is designed to show what the public would think about those issues if had time for earnest reflection and access to more complete information. Because the focus is on constructing a sample of a hypothetical public attitude, however, the actual Deliberative Polling event has to be highly structured and well organized. Conveners must have access to extensive technical expertise to recruit participants, compose background-briefing materials, and enter and analyze resulting survey data. They also must have sufficient civic resources to pay and train aides and moderators able to ensure a nonpartisan approach to deliberations and discussions, organize the event itself, facilitate media coverage, and disseminate the polling results.<a href=""#cite_note-sixteen-15"" title="""">[16]</a></p><p>The distinctive procedural features of this polling method include a random sample, balanced background materials, and a series of formal surveys or questionnaires. While the length of deliberation during the actual ‘event’ may vary, in general, deliberations occur over of the course of one or two days. Prior to the event, prospective participants are required to fill out an initial questionnaire and, once returned, are sent background materials that present a range of information and perspectives on the questions under consideration.<a href=""#cite_note-seventeen-16"" title="""">[17]</a></p><p>During the day(s) of deliberation, participants are informed they are being assembled as a representative cross-section of the larger public. Ideally, providing this information to participants encourages them to adopt an attitude more orientated towards consideration of the potential public, rather than personal, benefits that might result from a particular policy option. That said, appealing to narrower reasons in advocating a specific policy position is not illegitimate. The content of what participants are allowed to say in group-sessions is not restricted, nor is the language in which opinions are articulated. They are also not instructed to stick to the use of logical argument, refrain from personal narratives, or to refer only to the ‘common good’.<a href=""#cite_note-eighteen-17"" title="""">[18]</a> There are also no formal limits placed on how long an individual may speak, although moderators are instructed to ensure that all participants are allowed to have a voice in deliberations.</p><p>Generally speaking, the process of conducting a Deliberative Poll, including the proceedings on the day(s) of deliberation, can be broken down into a five-step process:<a href=""#cite_note-nineteen-18"" title="""">[19]</a></p><ol><li>A random, representative sample of the public is contacted and asked to provide feedback on an initial questionnaire aimed at evaluating the knowledge, perceptions, and preferences of the general public on a specific question.</li><li>Another random representative sample of citizens are contacted and asked to participate in a ‘deliberative event’ to be held over the course of one or two days.</li><li>In the lead up to the event, selected participants receive balanced briefing materials vetted by a panel of experts pertaining to the topics to be discussed.</li><li>On the day of the deliberative event participants are randomly assigned to small groups with trained moderators. During the group-sessions, the participants are encouraged to develop questions to pose a panel of experts and policymakers at a plenary session held towards the end of the event.</li><li>The event concludes with all participants filling out a second questionnaire intended to capture their considered opinions on the topic at hand. The results of the first poll are compared to the final poll, and any changes in opinion are measured and analyzed by trained pollsters. In most cases, the findings of the final survey are disseminated to the public through media coverage and, in some cases, form the basis of further debate and deliberations by politicians and policy-makers.</li></ol><p><a id=""Outcomes_and_Effects"" name=""Outcomes_and_Effects""></a></p><h2>Outcomes and Effects</h2><p>The opinion data produced from Deliberative Polling experiments have been used to various ends – depending on the original agenda of sponsoring organizations, the extent of media coverage, and whether or not the events results are connected directly to political policy-making processes.<a href=""#cite_note-twenty-19"" title="""">[20]</a> In most cases, however, the most productive outcome of Deliberative Polling events has been the perceived strength and accuracy of the survey data when compared to other polling methods. Given that citizens are articulating ‘consider judgments’ this data has been considered more legitimate by policy-makers attempting to gauge public support for different, often difficult, policy decisions.</p><p>As a survey method, the opinion projection data obtained through Deliberative Polling techniques are intended to provide a more accurate representation of public sentiment on a given issue. The accuracy of the data obtained when comparing the initial ‘baseline’ survey to the data obtained from the final ‘exit’ survey following deliberations has been found to be enhanced when deliberations are prolonged over multiple days rather than just a single one.<a href=""#cite_note-twenty_one-20"" title="""">[21]</a> Nevertheless, in both single and multi-day events the representative microcosm of participants has been found to be highly representative, both attitudinally and demographically, as compared to census data about the entire population.</p><p>Almost every Deliberative Polling experiment conducted thus far has also resulted in a number of large and statistically significant changes of opinion following the deliberative event. Considering the results of all Deliberative Polling experiments together, on average about two-thirds of the opinion items have changed following deliberation.<a href=""#cite_note-twenty_two-21"" title="""">[22]</a> Consequently as an opinion poll, the considered judgments arrived at following deliberation have been argued to be superior (and are often different from) the expressed attitudes solicited through conventional polls.</p><p><a id=""Examples"" name=""Examples""></a></p><h2>Examples</h2><p>To date, a number of Deliberative Polling experiments have been conducted with varying degrees of scope for the complexity of the public issues being discussed, the scale of deliberative events (including number of participants, and ties to future policy outcomes.

Of the entire population of Zeguo, 275 people were randomly selected to participate in surveys and deliberations taking place throughout the months of March and April, 2005. On April 30, 2005 the results of the poll were presented to Zeguo’s local People’s Congress for further debate and deliberation by local politicians – a majority of whom voted to fund the top twelve projects ranked in the Deliberative Poll. After encouraging results from the first Poll held in 2005, a second was held in the Zeguo Township in February 2008 and opened the entire budget to participatory feedback.<a href=""#cite_note-twenty_three-22"" title="""">[23]</a></li></ul><ul><li>Marousi, Greece (June 2006): The PASOK, one of Greece’s two major political parties, decided to apply a Deliberative Polling method to select its candidate for mayor in the City of Marousi. A representative sample of 153 citizens from the area were asked to come together and deliberate over six possible candidates, consider their records, pose questions, and at the end provide an advisory survey that ended up constituting the PASOK’s official candidate decision.

The exact methods of the poll have often been refined and modified to suit particular questions, events, or contexts with each version having distinct advantages and disadvantages.</p><p>In analyzing the results of various Deliberative Polling experiments completed to date, Fishkin has argued the there are four key findings. First, participants’ opinions at the end of the process often substantially change from the beginning in comparison with control groups or other surveys of the population. Second, given the information provided to participants prior to deliberation, those who participate are often more informed after the polling process is completed. Third, these changes of opinion are, in most cases, associated with processes of learning as participants begin to alter their views in response to increased information on a topic. Finally, the emphasis placed on deliberation and discussion during the polling process has had the effect of increasing citizens’ feelings of efficacy and engagement with the political process as a whole.<a href=""#cite_note-thirty-29"" title="""">[30]</a></p><p>Fishkin’s findings do differ depending on the level and scope of a given Deliberative Polling experiment. When Deliberative Polling has been used on the national level, it has had the advantage of creating a fairly diverse microcosm of an entire country, ready to confront trade-offs and divisive issues, and providing a guide to others looking to follow informed opinion. This has been particularly true in instances, such as Manchester in 1994, where the polling event is combined with a national broadcast and extensive media coverage.<a href=""#cite_note-thirty_one-30"" title="""">[31]</a> Through widespread dissemination of polling results, citizens who did not participate in deliberations have a chance to access the conclusions and key concerns of deliberators and use them as a guide for their own political behaviour. Such events are incredibly expensive, however, and most often Deliberative Polls have been far less ambitious and benefit from operating on a more local level where the face-to-face interactions fostered in the poll can be followed up with broader and more informal discussions at a later date.<a href=""#cite_note-thirty_three-31"" title="""">[32]</a></p><p>However, where Deliberative Polling events are widely covered by the media many critics have argued that the final survey data produced by the poll by be seriously flawed. As Robert Shapiro points out, for instance, The Deliberative Poll can only project what public opinion (more broadly construed) can look like under certain tightly controlled conditions.<a href=""#cite_note-Shapiro-32"" title="""">[33]</a> Everett C. Ladd has added to scepticism about the accuracy of survey data obtained through multiple polling events, by pointing out that the judgements arrived at by participants in Deliberative Polls are likely to be influenced by the ‘Hawthorne effect’.<a href=""#cite_note-Ladd-33"" title="""">[34]</a> Under controlled conditions subjects have been known to improve in the aspect of their behaviour being experimentally measured simply in response to the fact that they are being studied, and not in response to any particular experimental manipulation. In Deliberative Polling events – many of which have received a fair amount of media attention – there has been considerable worry that the judgements reached by participants may display biases of precisely this type, with subjects responding to the spotlight rather than increased knowledge about the subject.<a href=""#cite_note-Ladd_b-34"" title="""">[35]</a></p><p>Rather than representing an accurate picture of considered public opinion, Fishkin has also argued that Deliberative Polling might also achieve the creation of a counterfactual opinion – that is, that poll results can represent a projection that has recommending force when disseminated to the broader public. Put this way, a counterfactual representation of public opinion might suggest to the rest of the population some conclusions about a specific issue that they ought to take seriously because it comes from a relatively trustworthy proxy.<a href=""#cite_note-proxy-35"" title="""">[36]</a> This is relatively different use of the method than the one first recommended by Fishkin in attempting to correct conventional opinion polls, but it is also a role recent experiments in places such as Greece, Brazil, and China have pushed Deliberative Polling towards.</p><p><a id=""References"" name=""References""></a></p><h2>References</h2><ol class=""references""><li id=""cite_note-one-0""><a href=""#cite_ref-one_0-0"" title="""">↑</a> James Fishkin and Cynthia Farrar 'Deliberative Polling: From Experiment to Community Resource' in John Gatsil and Peter Levine (eds.)

"<a name=""Definition"" id=""Definition""></a><h2>Definition</h2>
<p><a href=""/w/index.php?title=Forum_theatre&action=edit&redlink=1"" class=""new"" title=""Forum theatre (page does not exist)"">Forum theatre</a> (also known as ‘popular theatre’ or ‘participatory theatre’) is, at base, theatre as democratic political forum. Each project is stimulated by a specific community’s experience of disempowerment and struggle, and the desire for creative solutions and capacity-building through egalitarian means. Forum theatre is designed to achieve this by, first, developing a conventional play that reflects the community’s lived experience of a chosen issue and culminates in unresolved crisis within that context. This play is then presented to the broader public in a participatory format such that the knowledge, aspirations and capacities of this public may be brought to bear on the exploration of viable solutions on the stage. After observing the play a first time, the play is performed again; audience members are invited to stop the play at any point, replace a character whose experience they feel they understand, and attempt to change the course of dramatic action. In this way, spectators are transformed into “spect-actors”, not only observing but truly acting to change the scenes they are presented (Boal 1995: 13).

<a name=""History"" id=""History""></a><h2>History</h2>
<p>Forum Theatre was most originally developed by Brazilian popular educator, cultural activist, dramatist, director and city councillor Augusto Boal in 1973 as part of a Peruvian literacy program. Over 40 years later, it is now practiced in schools, factories, prisons, and beyond in over 70 countries to address an even broader range of political issues. Rooted in the Brazilian social movements of the 1950s and 1960s and based Paolo Freire’s model of participatory education in Pedagogy of the Oppressed, it is designed to represent experiences of social and political oppression in order to stimulate community dialogue and problem-solving. It is an integral aspect of Boal’s critical pedagogy known as Theatre of the Oppressed and reflects this particular framework; however, it is flexible enough to be useful within even broader contexts.
</p><p>Boal himself was arrested, tortured and exiled by the Brazilian in 1971 for his cultural work, and as a consequence systematized and taught his methodology largely during his years abroad in Paris. Multiple Centres for Theatre of the Oppressed and affiliated companies were established internationally during this time, to be brought back to Brazil with Boal’s return in 1986 following the removal of the military junta. Theatre of the Oppressed has since continued to expand exponentially as it is adopted by practitioners and communities worldwide; Forum Theatre remains its most central component.

<a name=""Values_and_Goals"" id=""Values_and_Goals""></a><h2>Values and Goals</h2>
<p>·	Trust
·	Spontaneity and creativity
·	Collaboration
·	Listening and awareness
·	Communication
·	Effective interaction
·	Confidence and Capacity
·	Information Collection
·	Problem-solving
·	Incitement to change vs catharsis
·	Community development
</p><p>Several goals and values structure and guide this work. First and foremost, it is designed to be <a href=""/w/index.php?title=About,_by_and_for_communities_struggling_with_oppression&action=edit&redlink=1"" class=""new"" title=""About, by and for communities struggling with oppression (page does not exist)"">about, by and for communities struggling with oppression</a> – though what is experienced as oppression is left open to definition by the community in question.<a href=""#cite_note-name-0"" title="""">[1]</a> Whether addressing the dynamics and effects of racism, addiction or domestic violence, whether speaking to external or internal obstacles and pressures, Forum Theatre is “subjunctive theatre”, in which “a spectator intervenes and changes the vision of the world as it is into a world as it could be” (Picher 82; Boal 1979:132). It is designed to provide the tools with which to observe, analyse and change one’s reality; to understand underlying power relations, mechanisms and root causes of various forms of oppression and experiment in their transformation at the interpersonal level. 
</p><p>From this overarching framework stem other guiding principles. As a vehicle for empowerment and community dialogue, Forum Theatre works through <a href=""/w/index.php?title=Dialectic_rather_than_didactic&action=edit&redlink=1"" class=""new"" title=""Dialectic rather than didactic (page does not exist)"">dialectic rather than didactic</a> means. It is designed to “pose good questions, but the audience must supply the answers.” As Boal states, “it is not the place of the theatre to show the correct path, but only to offer the means by which all possible paths may be examined” (Boal 1979: 141). Actors and audience alike “learn together,” as people are given the opportunity to explore, rehearse and test various possible solutions to proposed dilemmas on the stage (Boal 2002: 242). In so doing, it tries to create the conditions within which marginalized communities might shake off some of the “ideology of expertise” and discover, develop and validate local knowledge and critical capacity (Picher 81; Sitvin 2006). 
</p><p>This also alludes to a third aim of Forum Theatre: the development of expressive capacities and access of information <a href=""/w/index.php?title=Beyond_the_merely_verbal&action=edit&redlink=1"" class=""new"" title=""Beyond the merely verbal (page does not exist)"">beyond the merely verbal</a>. While Forum Theatre is designed primarily to stimulate community discussion, this discussion is carried out through action. By inviting spect-actors to act out rather than merely describe their proposed solutions, Forum Theatre can explore and test these proposals such that both their hidden presumptions and unexpected consequences might be discovered and explored: “Often a person is very revolutionary when in a public forum he envisages and advocates revolutionary and heroic acts; on the other hand, he often realizes that things are not so easy when he himself has to practice what he suggests” (Boal 1979: 139). Moreover, many of the games and exercises that are used during the workshop/rehearsal phase of Forum are designed to help community participants access and develop various modes of perception, expression and knowledge beyond those of conventional dialogue: the body, the image, the sonic, and the kinetic.
</p><p>A fourth normative goal of Forum Theatre is to <a href=""/w/index.php?title=Enable_clearer_observation_and_reflection&action=edit&redlink=1"" class=""new"" title=""Enable clearer observation and reflection (page does not exist)"">enable clearer observation and reflection</a> of everyday dynamics and dilemmas. As theatre allows audiences to examine more closely the various underlying forces, relations, motivations, and root causes behind lived experience, it provides a context for deepening understanding and imagining unexplored alternatives (Boal 1998: 7). Forum Theatre maximizes on this capacity by enabling not only audience observation but also interaction with and transformation of what is observed: its participatory format is a “mirror which we can penetrate to modify our image” to become “protagonists of [our] own lives” (Boal 1995: 28-9; Jackson xxiv). 
</p><p>This leads into a fifth major goal of Forum Theatre: the rehearsal of various forms of action within the safe space of the theatre <a href=""/w/index.php?title=Prepares_participants_for_action&action=edit&redlink=1"" class=""new"" title=""Prepares participants for action (page does not exist)"">prepares participants for action</a> beyond the theatre. In examining the complexity of a given issue and possible strategies for effective response, Forum theatre “trains [people] for real action”, ideally awakening a sense of heightened capacity, creativity and desire to carry such practice into one’s own life (Boal 1979: 122; 142).
</p>
<a name=""Process"" id=""Process""></a><h2>Process</h2>
<a name=""Participant_Selection"" id=""Participant_Selection""></a><h3>Participant Selection</h3>
<p>Performers might be professional actors, although it is more common that they be drawn from the community affected by the given issue. Forum performances are always staged for community audiences. 
</p><p>The community members involved might be preformed and invite a Forum practitioner in to address a certain issue; this is commonly preferred, as it ensures the community is committed to exploring the issue and participating in the Forum process. However, projects have also been started with a specific issue already in mind; in these cases, community organizations and leaders might be enlisted to recruit community members for participation. In this case, the particular aspects of the issue ultimately presented within the Forum play are still chosen by the participants rather than the practitioner.
</p>
<a name=""Preparation"" id=""Preparation""></a><h3>Preparation</h3>
<p>Forum Theatre, whether a process of a 6-day workshop or many months, has three distinct phases. The first is designed to integrate the group, familiarize participants with the vocabulary of theatre, and increase their expressive capacity. The second introduces more issue-oriented activities to explore various perspectives and prepare the scenes to be presented. The third is the performance of the Forum play and facilitated interaction with the public (Boal 1979: 125; Boal 2002: 18-19). Where the process is longer than the workshop itself, the workshop serves to gather information that is applied and distilled during a rehearsal phase that can last several weeks. Here, a more complex, lengthy production is possible, as opposed to the sketches that emerge at the end of a workshop. The theme chosen for presentation is never imposed by the facilitator but rather emerges from the group, as this is seen to be vital to “a theatre which liberates” (Boal 2002: 19). 
</p><p>During the first and second phases, usually in the first four days of the Community Workshop, Forum Theatre uses many of the techniques developed within the Theatre of the Oppressed “arsenal”, consisting of exercises and games.<a href=""#cite_note-two-1"" title="""">[2]</a>  <a href=""/w/index.php?title=Exercises&action=edit&redlink=1"" class=""new"" title=""Exercises (page does not exist)"">Exercises</a> are those activities involving physical movement – respiratory, motor, or vocal – which help develop a better understanding of one’s body and its relation to space and other bodies. <a href=""/w/index.php?title=Games&action=edit&redlink=1"" class=""new"" title=""Games (page does not exist)"">Games</a> are activities that involve aspects of dialogue, and work to move participants beyond automatic ways of perceiving and responding to reality and awaken creative capacities. These are divided into the categories of “feel what we touch”, “listen to what we hear”, “see what we look at”, stimulate all the senses”, and “understand what we say and hear”.<a href=""#cite_note-three-2"" title="""">[3]</a>  It is important to note that these preparatory phases are seen as integral rather than merely preparatory, as they can contribute in themselves to building problem-solving abilities, consensus, capacity, and community: “in this context, every exercise, every game, every technique is both art and politics” (Boal 1998: 48). Games and exercises are open to adaptation according to group needs or restrictions (Boal 1998: 47).
</p><p>An important technique used during the second phase of Forum Theatre and often used alone is that of <a href=""/w/index.php?title=Image_Theatre&action=edit&redlink=1"" class=""new"" title=""Image Theatre (page does not exist)"">Image Theatre</a>. This is used to reveal underlying truths and commonalities within a community without initially resorting to spoken language. Participants sculpt their own or others’ bodies as “intelligent clay” (Boal 1979: 135) to represent images from their experiences, feelings and perspectives. These are then dynamized or brought to life via movement or sound to discover the motivations inherent in them (Jackson xxii). Image Theatre can be used to access subconscious feelings or thoughts by bypassing “the censorship of the brain” so overdeveloped where language is concerned (Jackson xxiii). It is also useful in its ability to render multiple, often related meanings beyond the intention of the sculptor, realizing latent connections. It is also a creative method to explore the feasibility of possible transitions between actual and ideal scenarios when directly juxtaposed in physical form (Boal 1979: 135). It is also effective in generating a means of communication for those who are usually excluded or intimidated through language. Lastly, in traditional Image Theatre, the group may adjust a certain image until consensus is reached that it is an accurate representation, contributing to consensus-building within the group.
</p>
<a name=""Performance"" id=""Performance""></a><h3>Performance</h3>
<p>Once a play is prepared through this process, it is then presented to the public as Forum Theatre. An early incarnation of Forum Theatre, still used today around the world, is <a href=""/w/index.php?title=Invisible_Theatre&action=edit&redlink=1"" class=""new"" title=""Invisible Theatre (page does not exist)"">Invisible Theatre</a>, a form of provocative street theatre in which the audience is unaware of the fiction they are witnessing. In this case, actors stage a conflict usually based on the subversion of “normal” behaviour in a public space, designed to provoke involvement and debate among spectators; often plants will also be hidden within the crowd to represent polarized perspectives and incite audience engagement. For the spectator, the fiction is real life; usually the performance will end without revealing otherwise (Jackson xxiii; Boal 2002: 241). 
</p><p>In Forum Theatre, the audience is aware of their involvement as protagonists. The play must be designed to depict various aspects of a given issue and culminate in unresolved crisis and the failure of protagonists’ solutions. First, the play is performed as conventional theatre of approximately 10-30 minutes. When the play is run a second time, the audience is invited to shout “stop” at any point and take the place of any character whose struggles they feel they understand. In traditional Forum Theatre, this must only be a character depicted as oppressed, or one seen as struggling; in other versions (see Adaptations) this is extended to all characters. They must then attempt to alter the course of dramatic action by trying alternative solutions. These changes must not be “magic” – that is to say, they must respect the realistic parameters set by the characters and context. The actors within the scene must improvise responses to these interventions such that each proposed solution is confronted with realistic tensions and responses, and the consequences and drawbacks of each solution are explored live. If an intervention fails, the play continues until another spect-actor stops the play again; if it succeeds, the audience is then invited to replace an oppressor character to find new ways to challenge the oppressed character. In either case, once the consequences of the change are played out, the actors return to the run of the play to allow for further interventions (Boal 1979: 139). 
</p><p>All of this is facilitated by the <a href=""/w/index.php?title=Joker&action=edit&redlink=1"" class=""new"" title=""Joker (page does not exist)"">Joker</a>, who explains the rules, corrects errors, encourages interventions, and draws out themes and realizations, all without imposing herself on the process or dictating the course of events. The Joker or “wild card” leader is best understood as an “exegete” rather than a “custodian of the truth; the Joker’s job is simply to try to ensure that those who know a little more get the chance to explain it, and that those who dare a little, dare a little more and show that they are capable of” (Boal 2002: 245).

<a name=""_Legislative_Theatre"" id=""_Legislative_Theatre""></a><h3>Decision-Making: Legislative Theatre</h3>
<p>This is an optional extension of Forum Theatre, developed by Boal during his tenure as City Councillor of Rio de Janeiro from (1993-96) as a way to integrate the political contributions of Forum Theatre within political decision-making institutions: “by making theatre as politics rather than merely making political theatre” (Boal 1998: 20). During Boal’s term in office, 20 laws were passed through this process; it has also been used in Canada and the United Kingdom.
</p><p>In this process, Forum Theatre is created and performed concerning proposed laws, as a means to directly involve everyday citizens in policy-making. Once the Forum is completed, a Chamber consisting of representatives of the affected community is created where proposals based on spect-actors’ interventions are presented, debated and voted upon akin to official procedure. The recommendations so approved are then collected and presented to lawmakers. Given the nature of the particular process, workshops and projects might run from two hours to two years (Boal 1998: 40).<a href=""#cite_note-four-3"" title="""">[4]</a>

<p>Forum Theatre has been shown to work successfully across a remarkable range of cultural, political and social differences and demands. It has been used by peasants and workers, students and teachers, artists, social workers, psychotherapists, NGOs, among others; in schools, streets, churches, trade-unions, theatres, and prisons.<a href=""#cite_note-five-4"" title="""">[5]</a>

The aim was to create effective means to improve the conditions of implementing human rights and citizenship for prisoners and staff of the Prison System in the State of São Paulo. The project culminated in the presentation of three Forums by female and male prisoners and prison guards at the Carandiru Prison.

<a name=""Adaptations"" id=""Adaptations""></a><h2>Adaptations</h2>
<p>Boal was famous for making clear that “whatever isn’t expressly forbidden, is allowed”; and while the guidelines for Forum Theatre are described in Boal’s work to extraordinary detail, they have been inevitably adapted by various practitioners due to divergent philosophies or agendas.  
</p><p><a href=""/w/index.php?title=Theatre_for_Living&action=edit&redlink=1"" class=""new"" title=""Theatre for Living (page does not exist)"">Theatre for Living</a> (David Diamond)
While very similar to Boal’s Theatre of the Oppressed, this was developed out of an acknowledgement that lines between oppressor and oppressed not so clear as Boal’s dichotomy presumes. Theatre for Living is designed to represent all characters in their complexity and leave room for intervention and exploration of all characters and their potential motivations and possibilities (Diamond 40-43). 
</p><p><a href=""/w/index.php?title=Rainbow_of_Desire&action=edit&redlink=1"" class=""new"" title=""Rainbow of Desire (page does not exist)"">Rainbow of Desire</a>
Boal developed this series of techniques later in his career to speak to oppressions to subjectivity and psychic life, after various projects with European communities revealed patterns of internalized oppression. It strives to isolate, analyze and directly confront the multiple “cops in the head” that often dictate human behaviour, perception and esteem (Boal 1995). While it can be used in isolation to contend with psychological problems, this method is now used as part of the “arsenal” in the process of making any play.
</p>
<a name=""Analysis_and_Criticism"" id=""Analysis_and_Criticism""></a><h2>Analysis and Criticism</h2>
<p>Forum Theatre has proved extremely effective for addressing a wide-range of issues. However, there are certain elements that raise a number of questions and criticisms. The first of these is safety: in exploring delicate and contentious issues involving vulnerable communities, while the work is designed to empower and equip participants it also inevitably brings to the surface hidden feelings, fears and traumatic experiences. In doing so, facilitators must be particularly gifted at creating a safe context in which these raw emotions and experiences might be expressed and explored. Indeed, where Forum Theatre is used to generate public dialogue and community knowledge rather than as explicit therapy, community support such as a social worker or therapist must be available in some way to provide for those individuals left exposed during and after the Forum process.
</p><p>This touches upon another aspect of Forum: the necessary prevention of a “hit and run” community process. This term is common within ethical discussions of community arts activism, and refers to processes that fail to be accountable and present for the longer-term effects of a singular event. As Forum theatre is usually used to address specific problems within a limited time-frame, it runs the risk of moving on after performances without community follow-up. Here, relationships with the community in question and its various organizations and support systems might be developed and made visible during the Forum event such that community members are aware of available resources.
</p><p>Linked to both of these risks is the criticism of Invisible Theatre in particular: designed to be provocative and perceived as real to bystanders, Invisible Theatre has sometimes presented at times violent and dangerous scenarios – domestic disputes and potential suicides, for example – which have led at times to emergency services interventions. In London, this has led to a banning of Invisible Theatre on the Underground. The question arises as to the ethical limits and social responsibilities of Invisible Theatre performers; certainly, it begs caution concerning safety for any potential production.

"<p>Collaborative governance is a young, emerging form of governance being developed to adapt the traditional aims of direct democracy with the new capabilities presented by the internet. Practical development of this governance method is being undertaken by the <a href=""/organizations/metagovernment"" title=""Metagovernment"">Metagovernment</a> project.
</p><p>Traditional implementations of direct participation have labored under enormous obstacles. First there are the technical obstacles of gathering all people together for each vote, then of meaningfully tallying so many votes. The existence of the internet and software remove these obstacles.
</p><p>However, that still leaves the much more profound criticisms of direct democracy: mob rule, demagoguery, issue overload, and tyranny of the majority. The Metagovernment project posits that, by careful application of sophisticated software, these issues can be used to solve each other. Simply put, mob rule and demagoguery result from focusing governance on a few hot-button issues. Issue overload is only a problem because of the demands of a majority rule system, requiring that there be massive participation on each of these few hot-button decisions. By contrast, collaborative governance opens up every decision to everyone. Nobody is expected to participate in each decision, but those who do must come to a consensus or no action is taken.

it gives no individual or group an advantage over others.  Hence, it offers no incentive for power-seeking individuals or groups to advocate its adoption.<br /><br />True democracy requires that the people have the desire and energy to seek out those of their fellows who are better able to resolve public problems than themselves and the humility to recognize that there may be bias in their personal views.  While those qualities are present in all of us, arranging a mechanism that uses them to govern society requires effort.</p><p><br /><a name=""Objective"" id=""Objective""><u><strong>Objective</strong></u></a><br />The realities of life, particularly our economic needs, tend to distract us from serious thought about public concerns.  When, as in the United States, the political infrastructure militates against public decision-making (<a href=""#Appendix - Partisanship"">see Appendix</a>), the people's political talents atrophy.  If we are to create an environment in which deliberative democracy is practical, we must create a framework in which citizens are encouraged to discuss their political concerns with their peers.<br /><br />Effective political dialogue is best encouraged by arranging the electorate into small groups to discuss matters of public concern.  Since public issues are inseparable from the people who resolve them, the groups must identify the individuals who best represent their interests in resolving their concerns.  Each group can do that by selecting a group member to represent the group's interests.  The people so chosen can deliberate with the choices of other groups to identify the most pressing issues and the individuals best suited to address them.  As Martin Carcasson said in Song Of A Citizen[<a href=""#fn1"">1</a>]:<br /><br />  ""When you give them (the people) a good process, they're<br />   able to not only do it, but then realize very quickly how<br />   much better it is than the other things they can do.""<br /><br />This approach lets the people advance those they believe have the qualities necessary to resolve public issues into ever-more deliberative groups to work out solutions from broadly differing perspectives.  This method gives effect to the concept of gyroscopic representation described by Jane Mansbridge in The Fallacy of Tightening The Reins[<a href=""#fn2"">2</a>], her keynote address to the Austrian Political Science Association in 2004.</p><p><br /><u><strong><a name=""Inclusiveness"" id=""Inclusiveness"">Inclusiveness</a></strong></u><br />To make the process inclusive we must determine the group size best suited to encourage every member of the community to participate.  Groups must be large enough to make a decision and small enough to encourage those who are not accustomed to the serious discussion of political issues to express their views.<br /><br />If we examine the dynamics of such a process, we find that, when a group of people meet to select one of their number to represent the others, there will be three kinds of participants:<br /><br />    those who do not want to be selected<br />    those willing to be selected, and<br />    those seeking selection.<br /><br />If none of the participants are willing to be selected, the group will not make a choice and will drop from the process.  Among groups that make a selection, those who are selected will be somewhere on the continuum from those willing to be selected to those seeking selection.  For simplicity, we will assume that the desire to be selected is equivalent to a desire for public office (as the people's representative) and that the people we mention as examples are at one end of the wish-willingness continuum or the other.  The reality is infinitely more complex, but the results will differ only in degree from what we learn by thinking about the people who are at the hypothetical extremes.<br /><br />The purpose of the process is to advance the best advocates of each group's perspective on contemporary issues.  In a pyramiding process of the type under discussion, it is reasonable to think that active seekers of advancement will succeed more frequently than those who only advance because they are willing to be selected.  Thus, after several iterations of the process, we can anticipate that all group members will be individuals who want to persuade their peers they have the qualities needed to advocate the group's interest.<br /><br />When persuasion occurs between two people, it takes place as a dialogue with one person attempting to persuade the other.  In such events, both parties are free to participate in the process. The person to be persuaded can question the persuader as to specific points, and present alternatives.  Under such circumstances, it is possible that the persuader will become the persuaded.<br /><br />However, when persuasion involves multiple people, it has a greater tendency to occur as a monologue.  The transition from dialogue to monologue accelerates as the number of people to be persuaded increases.  The larger the number of people, the less free some of them are to participate in the process.  In such circumstances, the more assertive individuals will dominate the discussion and the viewpoints of the less assertive members will not be expressed.<br /><br />Viewed this way, we can say that when selecting representatives of the public interest, a system that encourages dialogue is preferable to one that relies on a monologue, and dialogue can best be encouraged by having fewer people in the ""session of persuasion"".  Under these circumstances, the optimum group size to ensure the inclusion and encourage the active involvement of the entire electorate is three.<br /> </p><p><a id=""PRACTICAL_DEMOCRACY"" name=""PRACTICAL_DEMOCRACY""></a></p><h1>PRACTICAL DEMOCRACY</h1><h4><a id=""Method"" name=""Method""></a>Method</h4><p>1) Divide the entire electorate into groups of three randomly chosen people.</p><blockquote>a) The random grouping mechanism must insure that no two people are assigned to a triad if they served together in a triad in any of the five most recent elections.  At the initial level, it must ensure that no two people are assigned to a triad if they are members of the same family.</blockquote><blockquote>b) At any time up to one week before an election, people may declare themselves members of any interest group, faction, party, or enclave, and may create a new one, simply by declaring membership in it. People that do not declare group membership are automatically assigned to a set of people with no affiliation. Triads will be created from members of the same interest group, as long as more than two members of the group exist. When a group has less than three members, the group's remaining candidates are merged with unaligned candidates.</blockquote><blockquote>c) For the convenience of the electorate, triad assignments shall be based on geographic proximity to the maximum extent practical, subject to the foregoing restrictions.</blockquote><p>2) Assign a date and time by which each triad must select one of the three members to represent the other two.</p><blockquote>a) Selections will be made by consensus. If consensus cannot be achieved, selection will be by vote. Participants may not vote for themselves.</blockquote><blockquote>b) If a triad is unable to select a representative in the specified time, all three participants shall be deemed disinclined to participate in the process.</blockquote><p>3) Divide the participants so selected into new triads.</p><p>4) Repeat from step 2 until a target number of selections is reached.</p><p>For convenience, we refer to each iteration as a 'Level', such that Level 1 is the initial grouping of the entire electorate, Level 2 is the grouping of the selections made at Level 1, and so forth. The entire electorate participates at level 1 giving everyone an equal opportunity to advance to succeeding levels.</p><h4><a id=""Elective_and_Appointive_Offices"" name=""Elective_and_Appointive_Offices""></a>Elective and Appointive Offices</h4><p>The final phase of the Practical Democracy (PD) process, electing candidates to specific public offices, is omitted from this outline because that task is implementation-dependent. Whatever method is used, it is recommended that participants who reach the highest levels but do not achieve public office become a pool of validated candidates from which appointive offices must be filled.</p><h4><a id=""Description"" name=""Description""></a>Description</h4><p>An Electoral Commission conducts the process. It assigns the participants of each <a href=""#Group Size"">triad</a> and supplies the groups with the text of pending ordinances and a synopsis of the budget appropriate to the group. In addition, on request, it makes the full budget available and supplies the text of any existing ordinances. This enables a careful examination of public matters and encourages a thorough discussion of matters of public concern.</p><ul><li>The public has a tendency to think of elections in terms of just a few offices: a congressional seat, a senate race, and so forth. There are, however, a large number of elected officials who fill township, county, state and federal offices. The structure outlined here provides qualified candidates for those offices.</li></ul><ul><li>As the process advances through the levels, the life of the triads (the amount of time the participants spend together) increases. At level 1, triads may meet for a few minutes, over a back-yard fence, so-to-speak, but that would not be adequate at higher levels. As the levels advance, the participants need more time to evaluate those they are grouped with and to research, examine and deliberate on the issues concerning them. (See ""Time Lapse Example"", below.)</li></ul><ul><li>Face-to-face meetings in three-person groups eliminate any possibility of voting machine fraud. Significantly, they also allow participants to observe the non-verbal clues humans emit during discourse and will tend to favor moderate attitudes over extremism. The dissimulation and obfuscation that are so effective in campaign-based politics will not work in a group of three people, each of whom has a vital interest in reaching the same goal as the miscreant. Thus, the advancement of participants will depend on their perceived integrity as well as the probity with which they fulfill their public obligations.</li></ul><ul><li>PD is a distillation process, biased in favor of the most upright and capable of our citizens. It cannot guarantee that unprincipled individuals will never be selected --- such a goal would be unrealistic --- but it does insure that they are the exception rather than the rule.</li></ul><h4><a id=""Harnessing_the_Pursuit_of_Self-Interest"" name=""Harnessing_the_Pursuit_of_Self-Interest""></a>Harnessing the Pursuit of Self-Interest</h4><p>The pursuit of self-interest is a powerful force.  Allowed free rein, it can produce an anti-social menace.  However, when it is an advantage for an individual to be recognized as a person of principle, one's natural tendency to pursue one's own interest is more than adequate to avoid improper acts.  The PD process gives candidates a career-controlling incentive to maintain their integrity.  Their own self-interest provides the motivation.<br /><br />The initial phase of the PD process is dominated by participants with little interest in advancing to higher levels. They do not seek public office; they simply wish to pursue their private lives in peace. Thus, the most powerful human dynamic during the first phase (i.e., Level 1 and for some levels thereafter) is a desire by the majority of the participants to select someone who will represent them. The person so selected is more apt to be someone who is willing to take on the responsibility of going to the next level than someone who actively seeks elevation to the next level, but those who do actively seek elevation are not inhibited from doing so.<br /><br />As the levels increase, the proportion of disinterested parties diminishes and we enter a second phase. Here, participants that advance are marked, more and more, by an inclination to seek further advancement. Thus, the powerful influence of self-interest is integrated into the system.<br /><br />Those who actively seek selection must persuade their triad that they are the best qualified to represent the other two. While that is easy at the lower levels, it becomes more difficult as the process moves forward and participants are matched with peers who also seek advancement. The competitors will seek out any hint of impropriety and will not overlook unsuitable behavior. Thus, Practical Democracy harnesses the pursuit of self-interest by making integrity an absolute requirement in candidates for public office.</p><h4><a id=""Bi-Directionality"" name=""Bi-Directionality""></a>Bi-Directionality</h4><p>The process is inherently bi-directional. Because each advancing participant and elected official sits atop a pyramid of known electors, questions on specific issues can easily be transmitted directly to and from the electors for the guidance or instruction of the official. This capability offers those who implement the process a broad scope, ranging from simple polling of constituents to referenda on selected issues and recall of an elected representative.</p><h4><a id=""Simplified_Illustration"" name=""Simplified_Illustration""></a>Simplified Illustration</h4><p>This table illustrates the process for a community of 232,374 voters. For simplicity, it omits interest group considerations and assumes each triad selects a candidate. The process is shown through 9 levels. Those who implement the process will determine the number of levels necessary for their specific application.</p><p><code>                       Selected<br />                       Randomly<br />                         From<br />              Full  Over Prev.  Total People<br />Level People Triads Flow Level Triads Chosen  Days <br />  1  232,374 77,458   0    0   77,458 77,458    5 (1)<br />  2   77,458 25,819   1    2   25,820 25,820    5<br />  3   25,820  8,606   2    1    8,607  8,607   12<br />  4    8,607  2,869   0    0    2,869  2,869   12<br />  5    2,869    956   1    2      957    957   19<br />  6      957    319   0    0      319    319   19<br />  7      319    106   1    2      107    107   26<br />  8      107     35   2    1       36     36   26<br />  9       36     12   0    0       12     12   26 (2)</code></p><ol><li>If the number of candidates does not divide equally into triads, any candidates remaining are overflow. Level 1 is a special case. When there is overflow at Level 1, the extra person(s) automatically become candidates at Level 2. Thereafter, when there is overflow at any level, the number of people needed to create a full triad are selected at random from the people who were not selected at the previous level.</li><li>To avoid patronage, appointive offices, including cabinet positions, must be filled using candidates that reached the final levels but were not selected to fill elective offices.</li></ol><h4><a id=""Time_Lapse_Example"" name=""Time_Lapse_Example""></a>Time Lapse Example</h4><p>To give a very rough idea of the time lapse required for such an election, we will hypothesize triad lives of 5 days for the 1st and 2nd levels, 12 days for the 3rd and 4th levels, 19 days for the 5th and 6th levels, and 26 days thereafter. Using the example above, the time lapse for an election would be:</p><p><code>    Level  Start     Report   Days<br />       1   01/05/11  01/10/11    5<br />       2   01/12/11  01/17/11    5<br />       3   01/19/11  01/31/11   12<br />       4   02/02/11  02/14/11   12<br />       5   02/16/11  03/07/11   19<br />       6   03/09/11  03/28/11   19<br />       7   03/30/11  04/25/11   26<br />       8   04/27/11  05/23/11   26<br />       9   05/25/11  06/20/11   26<br /></code></p><h4><a name=""Cost And Time Consumption"" id=""Cost And Time Consumption""></a>Cost And Time Consumption</h4><p>The cost of conducting an election by this method is free to the participants, except for the value of their time, and minimal to the government. The length of time taken to complete an election compares favorably with the time required by campaign-based partisan systems. Even in California, with a voting-eligible population of about 21,993,429, the process would complete in less than 12 levels, or about 230 calendar days.</p><p>From the perspective of those not motivated to seek public office, it is worth noting that, as each level completes, two-thirds of the participants can resume their daily lives without further electoral obligation. At the same time, they retain the ability to guide or instruct their representatives to the extent and in the manner provided by those who implement the process. (See ""Bi-Directionality"", above)<br /> </p><h4><a id=""Concept"" name=""Concept""></a>Concept</h4><p>Practical Democracy springs from the knowledge that some people are better advocates of the public interest than others. In Beyond Adversary Democracy[<a href=""#fn3"">3</a>], Jane Mansbridge, speaking of a small community in Vermont, says, ""When interests are similar, citizens do not need equal power to protect their individual interests; they only need to persuade their wisest, cleverest, most virtuous, and most experienced citizens to spend their time solving town problems in the best interests of everyone.""[<a href=""#fn4"">4</a>]</p><p>The fundamental challenge of democracy is to find those ""wisest, cleverest, most virtuous, and most experienced citizens"" and empower them as our representatives. PD does that by giving every member of the electorate the right to be a candidate and the ability to influence the selection process, while ensuring that no individual or group has an advantage over others.</p><p>PD makes no attempt to alter the structure of government. We have the venues for resolving adversarial issues in our legislatures and councils. However, since the solutions that flow from those assemblies cannot be better than the people who craft them, PD lets the electorate select the individuals they believe will resolve adversarial issues in the public interest.</p><p>Peoples' interests change over time. To achieve satisfaction, these changing attitudes must be given voice and reflected in the results of each election. The PD process lets particular interests attract supporters to their cause and elevate their most effective advocates during each electoral cycle. Advocates of those interests can proclaim their ideas and encourage discussion of their concepts. Some will be accepted, in whole or in part, as they are shown to be in the common interest of the community.</p><p>Most people expect their elected officials to represent their interests. The difficulty is that communities are made up of diverse interests and the relations between those interests can be contentious. Constructive resolution of political issues requires, first of all, lawmakers with the ability to recognize the value in the various points of view, from the people's perspective. That is impossible for legislators elected to represent partisan interests.</p><p>Democracy's dilemma is to find those few individuals whose self-interest encourages them to seek advancement and whose commitment to the public interest makes them acceptable to their peers. Such persons can not be identified by partisan groups seeking to advance their own interests. They can only be identified by the people themselves.</p><h4><a id=""Why_Practical_Democracy_Works"" name=""Why_Practical_Democracy_Works""></a>Why Practical Democracy Works</h4><p>Practical Democracy gives the people a way to select Mansbridge's ""wisest, cleverest, most virtuous, and most experienced citizens"". At each level, voters deliberate in small groups, where ""... face-to-face contact increases the perception of likeness, encourages decision making by consensus, and perhaps even enhances equality of status.""[<a href=""#fn5"">5</a>] The value of this approach is underlined by recent academic studies of small group dynamics:</p><ul><li>Esterling, Fung and Lee show that deliberation in small groups raises both the knowledge level of the participants and their satisfaction with the results of their deliberations.<a href=""#fn6"">[6]</a></li></ul><ul><li>Pogrebinschi has found that ""... policies for minority groups deliberated in the national conferences tend to be crosscutting as to their content. The policies tend to favor more than one group simultaneously ...""<a href=""#fn7"">[7]</a></li></ul><p>These studies show some of the value of small groups. The PD process builds on these phenomena. It lets people with differing views deliberate and seek consensus on political issues. When triad members are selected to advance, those selected are the individuals the group believes best represent its perspectives. This necessarily adds a bias toward the common interest.</p><p>PD works because it atomizes the electorate into thousands, or, in larger communities, millions of <a href=""#Group Size"">very small groups</a>. Each provides a slight bias toward the common interest. As the levels advance, the cumulative effect of this small bias overwhelms special interests seeking their private gain. It leads, inexorably, to the selection of representatives who advocate the will of the community.</p><h4><u><a id=""Summary"" name=""Summary""></a>Summary</u></h4><p>PD focuses on selecting representatives who will resolve adversarial encounters to the advantage of the commonweal. During the process, participants necessarily consider both common and conflicting interests, and, because PD is intrinsically bidirectional, it gives advocates of conflicting interests a continuing voice. At the same time, it encourages the absorption of diverse interests, reducing them to their essential element: their effect on the participants in the electoral process. There are no platforms, there is no ideology. The only question is, which participants are the most attuned to the needs of the community and have the qualities required to advocate the common good.</p><p>PD disproves the notion that it is 'impractical' to heed everyone's view. It lets the public discuss substantive matters --- with a purpose. It gives participants time for deliberation and an opportunity to understand the rationale for the positions of others. It lets every member of the electorate affect the electoral process.</p><h4><a id=""Conclusion"" name=""Conclusion""></a>Conclusion</h4><p>PD is an electoral process through which the people actively participate in the conduct of, and impress their moral sense on, their government. It creates a unique merger of self-interest and the public interest. However large the electorate, Practical Democracy lets each of us share in the practice of politics to the full extent of our desire and ability.</p><p><u><em><strong>That is the essence of a democratic political process.</strong></em></u></p><p><a name=""Implementation"" id=""Implementation""><u><strong>Implementation</strong></u></a></p><p>In the 225-plus years since our nation's founding, partisan politics has firmly embedded itself in our political landscape.  It will not be displaced by confrontation.  The best chance for something like the Practical Democracy concept to develop will be if it is adopted in a small community.  I've heard that Aspen, Colorado and Burlington, Vermont attempted to change their vote counting methods in recent years.  That suggests there is dissatisfaction with the status quo and openness to alternatives.  If a small community adopts and proves the value of the PD approach, it will take root and spread.  As Carcasson wrote in Beginning with the End in Mind, ""As the number of communities with such organizations increase (and collaborate), the impact of the deliberative democracy movement will surely grow exponentially.""[<a href=""#fn8"">8</a>]<br /><br />Respectfully submitted,<br /><br />Fred Gohlke<br /> </p><h4><u><a id=""Footnotes"" name=""Footnotes""></a>Footnotes</u></h4><ol class=""references"" start=""1""><li><a name=""fn1"" id=""fn1"">Martin Carcasson, Song Of A Citizen<br />https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80GqgbAf3c8</a></li><li id=""cite_note-1""><a href=""#cite_ref-1"" title="""">↑</a> <a name=""fn2"" id=""fn2"">Beyond Adversary Democracy, Jane J.

When partisanship dominates the political scene, non-partisans are less likely to be politically active.  That does not mean they have no political interest or concern.  They do, but party domination of the proceeding gives them no viable means of participating in the process.  When the only choice a voter can make is the lesser of two evils, we should not be surprised if many of them won't support an evil.<br /><br />In sum, 44.7% of the people did not vote and 32% of those who did vote were Independents who rejected both parties.  In other words, 76.7% of the people were non-partisan.  So, while non-partisans are the largest portion of the electorate and should have the greatest voice in the conduct of our government, they were forced to stand mute or choose an option they couldn't fully support.<br /><br />That certainly does not express the will of the people.  It is disgracefully undemocratic - and unpublicized.  When the people are only allowed to choose from party-supplied options, the ability to choose one of them is neither free nor democratic.  On the contrary, since those who define the options control the outcome, it shows that the people are subjects of those who defined their options.  As Robert Michels pointed out in Political Parties[<a href=""http://socserv.mcmaster.ca/econ/ugcm/3ll3/michels/polipart.pdf"">1</a>], ""... the oligarchical and bureaucratic tendency of party organization ... serves to conceal from the mass a danger which really threatens democracy.""<br /><br />Party-dominated political infrastructures deny the people the right to decide the issues they want addressed and select the candidates they want to address them.  As a result, the peoply's political skills atrophy because the system gives them no meaningful participation in the political process.  We cannot know what treasures of political ability may be unearthed when people are invited to deliberate on their common concerns - with a purpose.  Some, who start out unsure of their ability, will, as they learn they can persuade others of the value of their perspective, gain confidence in their ability to influence the political process.  In doing so, the people gain the internal goods that can only be attained through the practice of politics. That, as Alasdair MacIntyre[<a href=""http://www.iep.utm.edu/p/p-macint.htm"">4</a>] explained, benefits the entire community.<br /><br />Partisanship is a potent tool for those with a thirst for power but it does not foster government by the people.  It disenfranchises non-partisans and results in government by a small fraction of the people.  For the people as a whole, the flaws in party politics are devastating.  Their cumulative effect victimizes the public by the most basic and effective strategy of domination --- divide and conquer.<br /><br />Parties are important for the principals:  the party leaders, financiers, candidates and elected officials, but the significance diminishes rapidly as the distance from the center of power grows.  Most people are on the periphery, remote from the centers of power.  As outsiders, they have little incentive to participate in the political process.<br /><br />The challenge of representative democracy is not to divide the public into blocs but to find the best advocates of the common interest and raise them to positions of leadership.  To meet that challenge, given the range of public issues and the way each individual's interest in political matters varies over time, an effective electoral process must examine the entire electorate during each election cycle, seeking the people's best advocates. It must let every voter influence the outcome of each election to the best of their desire and ability, and it must ensure that those selected as representatives are disposed to serve the public interest.<br /><br />Partisanship is a vital part of society ... provided it is always a voice and never a power.  The danger is not in partisanship, it is in allowing partisans to control government.<br /><br />Fred Gohlke<br /><br />[1] <a href=""http://socserv.mcmaster.ca/econ/ugcm/3ll3/michels/polipart.pdf"">http://socserv.mcmaster.ca/econ/ugcm/3ll3/michels/polipart.pdf</a><br />[2] <a href=""http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0781453.html"">www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0781453.html</a><br />[3] pewresearch.org/pubs/773/fewer-voters-identify-as-republicans<br />[4] <a href=""http://www.iep.utm.edu/p/p-macint.htm"">http://www.iep.utm.edu/p/p-macint.htm</a><br /> </p> ",en,151,Practical Democracy

"<p>A civic lottery, a popular term for the contemporary use of sortition or allotment, refers to a lottery-based method for selecting citizens for public service or office. It is based on the premise that citizens in a democracy have both a duty and the desire to serve their society by participating in its governance.
</p><p>Today, the most common use of the civic lottery process is found in many Anglo-Saxon judicial systems where citizen juries are summoned to hear and render verdicts in court cases. The term for this is popularly known as jury duty.
</p><p>Civic lotteries are increasingly popular in Canada, where provincial Citizens' Assemblies on Electoral Reform took place in British Columbia in 2004 and in Ontario in 2006. The membership of each Assembly was determined by a civic lottery which invited citizens to volunteer as candidates. In British Columbia, the government sent 23,034 letters to randomly identified citizens throughout the province. 1,715 replied and volunteered to serve as members of the Assembly. In Ontario, 123,489 citizens were identified during a random electronic draw from the Permanent Register of Electors. Each citizen received a letter inviting him or her to apply and 7,033 volunteered as candidates. Ultimately, during a final selection process 158 names were drawn from among the candidates to participate as members of the BC Assembly. 103 were selected as members in Ontario.
</p><p>MASS LBP, a Canadian company inspired by the work of the Citizens' Assembly on Electoral Reform (Ontario) has developed an increasingly sophisticated system for running civic lotteries to randomly select citizens to participate on government advisory panels. The lotteries, which ask citizens to give up several consecutive weekends to participate on a panel, enjoy a strong positive response rate, typically exceeding five percent. This suggests that citizens are more interested public affairs than declining voter-turnout rates indicate.
</p><p>Panel members are randomly selected from among the pool of candidate-respondents to create a panel that roughly matches the demographic profile of the wider population.

"<p><a id=""Definition"" name=""Definition""></a>A Citizens’ Jury is composed of a group often of around 18-24 randomly selected citizens, representative of the demographics in the area, that come together to deliberate on an issue. Over the period of 4-7 days the jury hears from expert witnesses that are knowledgeable on the topic and deliberate to provide a solution or recommendation to the public and official decision makers.</p><h2>Definition</h2><p>The process of deliberation allows all members of the jury to have his or her voice and opinion heard and considered. After the jury has come to a decision they present the recommendation in the form of a public forum. There is also a written report of the recommendation available to the public and the media. These juries allow decision makers to hear from informed citizens that help them make the best choice regarding the issue at hand.</p><p><a id=""Process"" name=""Process""></a></p><h2>Process</h2><p>The first step to creating a Citizens’ Jury is to select the people that will compose the jury. The jury must be a random sample that is representative of the public. There is careful planning and certain steps that must be taken in order to gather this group. After the jury has been selected the key witnesses must be chosen. These witnesses must be experts in the field of the issue and are generally made up of neutral resource people, stakeholders and advocates that take a certain side to the issue. The neutral resource people provide the jury with background information about the issue and their main job is to inform the jury and make them familiar with the issue. Stakeholders and advocates normally have taken a side on the issue. His or her job is to inform the jury about his or her side and explain why they have chosen or believe in that particular side to the issue. The witness selection is key because they must represent all sides so the jury can receive a balanced and complete picture of the issue.</p><p>After selecting the jury and the key witnesses, the jury gathers and the charge is issued. The charge is a question or group of questions that must be answered by the jury at the end of the process. The charge acts as a guideline for the jury and witnesses. The jury may choose to answer questions about the issue that are not in the charge but the Advisory Committee must approve them first. The charge is the structure the jury follows when planning the recommendation.</p><p>The first day the jury meets is dedicated to understanding the process that they are about to embark upon, receive a brief overview of the issue, and mostly to get comfortable with each other so they feel at ease and relaxed. The next 3 or 4 days is dedicated to hearings that include the expert witnesses. There is time allotted for the jurors to ask question of the witnesses and also time for them to deliberate. After all the hearings have been completed the rest of the time is set aside for the jurors to have final deliberations about the issue as well as answer the crucial charge question or questions.</p><p>On the final day there is a public forum held where the jurors present their findings and recommendation. There is also an initial report that is issued that is written by the jurors themselves in a language that they created. About two to three weeks later there is a final report issued that is available to the public.</p><p>The final stage to this process includes an evaluation that is filled out by the jurors. The jurors are asked to evaluate the process itself, the staff, and if they believed the process was biased or not. There is a portion for the jurors to add a personal statement, which is another way they can express their opinions. This evaluation is added into the final report that is made available to the public.</p><p><a id=""History"" name=""History""></a></p><h2>History</h2><p>In Minneapolis, Minnesota Ned Crosby founded the Jefferson Center, which originated the Citizens' Jury method and held a copyright on the term for many years.  It first used the method in 1974 on the issue of health care.  Around 1/3 of the 30+ Citizens' Juries held by the Jefferson Center have been held outside its home state of Minnesota.  Issues have included education, low-income housing, welfare reforms, climate change and physician-assisted suicide, as well as locally-relevant issues such as traffic congestion and agricultural practices.</p><p>In the early 1990s the Jefferson Center experimented with use of the Citizens' Jury method for evaluating candidates in upcoming elections, including examining the major candidates in the Governor’s race in Minnesota in 1990 and a U.S. Senate race in Pennsylvania in 1992. The application of the Citizens' Jury received a good deal of positive response from observers and media, and there was growing interest in expanding the process to other states.  However, in 1993 the Internal Revenue Service ruled that this activity was inappropriate for a 501c3 nonprofit organization, and the Jefferson Center agreed to stop using the Citizens' Jury method in this manner.  In 2005 Crosby and others incorporated a 501c4 nonprofit partner organization named Promoting Healthy Democracy, and it is planning applications of the Citizens' Jury method that include candidate evaluation.</p><p>A similar method called <em>Planungszelle</em> was invented independently in Germany by Peter Dienel and first used in 1972; Crosby and Dienel did not become aware of each others’ work until 1985.  The method has been copied by other organizations in Finland, Australia, Spain, Germany and elsewhere.  The government in Great Britain has held more than 300 Citizens' Juries, although these differ significantly from the method as the Jefferson Center implements it. </p><p><a id=""Case_Studies"" name=""Case_Studies""></a></p><h2>Case Studies</h2><p>Since the founding of the Jefferson Center and Citizens’ Juries there have been over 30 cases conducted. The first Citizens’ Jury was conducted in 1974 using a twelve-person jury to deliberate on Health Care Reform.  In 1984, five Citizens’ Juries with twelve people on each jury deliberated on the impact of agriculture on water quality in Minnesota. This project was for a Steering Committee of eleven organizations, 4 state agencies, two farms groups, and two environmental groups. This Citizens’ Jury was the first to meet during the day instead of at night.</p><p>In recent years, with early help from the Jefferson Center, the Citizens Jury method has been successfully used by a pair of independent organizations -- Healthy Democracy Oregon and the Healthy Democracy Fund -- to evaluate statewide ballot initiatives; this adaptation of the method is called a <a href=""http://participedia.net/methods/citizens-initiative-review"">Citizens' Initiative Review</a>.  The Jefferson Center and Promoting Healthy Democracy also ran a Citizens' Jury on Election Recounts in Minnesota in 2009 that was credited with helping build bipartisan support for reforms to that state’s recount procedures. </p><p><a id=""Evaluation"" name=""Evaluation""></a></p><h2>Evaluation</h2><p>There are different ways of evaluating Citizens’ Juries. The jurors themselves evaluate the process after they complete their task. These evaluations are available to the public through the final report issued three weeks after the completion of the process. After the jurors evaluate there is an overwhelming positive result. There is rarely a negative comment or rating from the jurors.</p><p>Another way the Citizens’ Juries are evaluated is by academic scholars that study this process. Choices without reasons: citizens’ juries and policy evaluation is an article written by David Price who evaluates this process. He has a more negative evaluation of this process. The problem he found to be most prominent is the recommendations have no reasons for why they chose a certain side and this is partly due to the way the charge is phrased.</p><p>There are many more evaluations done by other academics, people involved and committed to deliberation, and also ordinary citizens. This is not a comprehensive evaluation of the evaluation of the Citizens’ Juries.</p><p><a id=""Secondary_Sources"" name=""Secondary_Sources""></a></p><h2>Secondary Sources</h2><p>French, Damien, Michael Laver. “Participation bias and framing effects in citizens’ juries.” American Political Science Association (2005) 1-27.

It has been used for research, policy and teaching purposes. The exercise can be tailored and adapted to the needs of the populations/communities. Departments of Insurance in various states in the U.S. have used CHAT to determine public opinion about what should be included in basic health insurance packages for the uninsured. Some U.S. municipalities have used it to assess public priorities for direct service delivery to the uninsured.

<p>The model of participatory consensus conference often knows as “the Danish model” and/or “citizens’ panel,” is a way to deliberate on policy issues with high technical content using a combination of lay citizens. The consensus conference functions similar to a jury, but deliberates with lay citizens and experts on technical problems. Its central goals are to improve decision making about science and technology by expanding perspectives, as well as increasing the public's understanding of science and technology through public debate, and enhancing democracy by creating civic engagement.(1)
</p><p>
The consensus conference was developed in 1980s when the Danish Board of Technology (DBT) began looking at the US Office of Technology Assessment (OTA). The key difference between the two methods, the OTA and the consensus conference, are including the lay people’s opinions, arguments, concerns and reasons in regards to different issues of societal relevance. This also can include allowing the influence of lay perspectives in regulation and political decision making. (2)
</p>
<a name=""Process"" id=""Process""></a><h1>Process</h1>
<p>A crucial beginning factor in creating an effective consensus conference is establishing the citizen panel. The Danish Board of Technology (DBT) recruits participants by sending an informational invitation to a random telephone sample of 2000 lay citizens. In order for the applicant to participate in the consensus conference, they must send a letter to the DBT with a combination of information about themselves and their motives in order to participate in the panel. The DBT then chooses around 120 to 150 applicants with varied backgrounds regarding age, gender, occupation, education and geographical location. The final panel consists of 14 people along with experts and an advisory/planning committee. The panel becomes the functional elements of the consensus conference by acting similar to a jury. The panel consists of a committee who structures the process, along with the experts, who advise the panelists, and the staff members, who support the process. The citizen panel conducts a combination of questions between two weekends to be taken up with the experts at the conference. The experts must be open minded as well as good communicators. Their role includes thoroughly answering the questions of the panelist along with deliberating among each other for the best possible answer. (3)
</p><p>
There are two moderators, also known as the facilitator in a consensus conference whom are required to attend both the preparatory weekend and the final conference itself. The moderators must be professional and have experience in participatory processes. At the same time, the moderators will facilitate a fair dialogue among the lay panel participants and ensure substantial information that is transferred from the experts. A key factor in participating as the moderator for a consensus conference is credibility, relevance to the topic itself and neutrality. The moderator must fully understand the procedure itself while being able to stay objective to a given topic. This will both require encouragement and making sure the panel clearly understands different views and/or issues brought up by peer participants. (2)
</p><p>
The four day conference begins with a presentation given by the experts of their answers to the questions from the citizen panel. The second day is reserved for discussion between the citizen panel, the experts, and the audience as well as clarifying questions. The rest of the second day and the following third day is reserved for the citizens panel to generate a final document which explains their conclusions along with recommendations. An open discussion is formed which includes much deliberation and conversing to where a final consensus of the document is reached. Throughout the morning of the fourth day, the citizen panel reads the final document to the experts along with the audience and/or press. (3)
</p>
<a name=""History"" id=""History""></a><h1>History</h1>
<p>The consensus conference was developed in the 1980s by The Danish Board of Technology (DBT), an independent institution established by the Danish Parliament (3). Shortly after in 1987, the first consensus conference was organized with the focus on “Gene technology in industry and agriculture” (2). Throughout the last ten years, the Danish Broad of Technology has accomplished 15 successful consensus conferences. They were able to enable successful conferences by ensuring the topic was of current interest, requiring expert knowledge,and incorporating conflicts issues that were relevant to the questions developed by the panel. The participatory consensus conference has now crossed boundaries from Europe in to the United States. In April of 1997, the first consensus conference was held in the United States covering ‘telecommunications and the future of Democracy’ (1).
</p>
<a name=""Case_Studies"" id=""Case_Studies""></a><h1>Case Studies</h1>
<p>There are multiple examples of the consensus conferences in action throughout the world. After Denmark proved this method of deliberative process could work, many countries followed. Some examples of the cases around the world that have used the consensus conference are the following:

<a name=""Evaluation"" id=""Evaluation""></a><h1>Evaluation</h1>
<p>An interesting aspect about the consensus conference is the fact that not all of the conferences are evaluated. A formal evaluation may not be required if the conference has become a known tool with no plans on future conferences as well as having the conference be carried out by an experienced organizing team. For the conferences that require an evaluation, the first step is deciding whether the evaluation should focus on internal or external aspects. 
</p><p>Internal aspects include the appropriateness of the selected experts, the quality of the interactions between the two panels, and the competence of the moderation and the quality of the output.  External aspects include the effects of the conference. This could consist of whether the relevant audiences were reached, and/or the evaluations along with questions if the lay panel made a difference in the debates on the specific topic of technology or science in question among policy makers, experts and the wider public. The evaluation of the consensus conference can be carried out by either the organizing team and/or be outsourced to external evaluators. A crucial step of the evaluation process is that the conference is evaluated in relation to the goals formulated in advance. In order to achieve this process, both the organizing team and/or the external evaluators must be aware of the premise to which the conference has been organized (2).

<p>The New England Town Meetings are open forums that promote democracy. The meetings include local and regional officials that attend in order to hear the communities view on public issues. Members can be invited. The town meetings are open and involve community members mainly in the New England states. During the deliberation process, community members vote on laws and budgets. ""Proponents of the town assembly emphasize that it is the purest form of democracy that ensures that all policy decisions are in the public interest since no intermediaries are placed between the voters and the public decisions.""<a href=""#cite_note-No_Author-0"" title="""">[1]</a> ""It's the closest to the people, it involves the largest number of people, its the most open.""<a href=""#cite_note-Perkins-1"" title="""">[2]</a>
</p>
<a name=""Problems_and_Purpose"" id=""Problems_and_Purpose""></a><h2>Problems and Purpose</h2>
<p>The purpose the New England Town Meetings are to include registered voters of the community to discuss new laws and budgets in a town forum. It is very similar to a town government. Some problems may arise are repetition  of issues discussed. For example, ""when the white House Republicans set out to orchestrate a public discussion on immigration reform in 2006, they chose to hold public hearings of this variety. Since the hearings concerned legislation on which Congress had already voted, he asked, 'why hold public hearings on bills that have already passed?"" <a href=""#cite_note-Gastil-2"" title="""">[3]</a> The town meetings can also be a place for the community to ""tell committee members what they want to hear.""<a href=""#cite_note-Gastil-2"" title="""">[3]</a> Some of the community members can use the town meetings to hear themselves speak rather than discuss relevant topics regarding their communities. 
</p><p>Another problem of the New England Town Meetings is the ""tendency towards acrimony and name-calling at public meetings. Daily newspapers routinely provide accounts of hostile adversaries sparring with one another at these public events, with the proceedings making little progress.""<a href=""#cite_note-Gastil-2"" title="""">[3]</a>
</p><p>Currently, there have been issues with low attendance levels. ""The most comprehensive study of participation in public meetings found that in the United States in 2003, twently-five percent of citizens reported attending one or more such meeting in the past year. The overwhelming majority (eighty-five percent) of those who had not attended any meetings said that they had never been invited to one."" <a href=""#cite_note-Gastil-2"" title="""">[3]</a>
</p>
<a name=""History"" id=""History""></a><h2>History</h2>
<p>The New England Town Meetings first began 300 years ago, approximately 1620 in the New England colonies. When the Puritans traveled to America in order to have religious freedom, they developed a type of town meeting to discuss particular issues. The meetings were held in colonial meeting houses which needed to meet at least two criteria. First, ""It was built at tax payer expense (except in Rhode Island), and it was used for both religious worship and town business."" <a href=""#cite_note-Wainwright-3"" title="""">[4]</a> Town meetings occur in Connecticut, Maine, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and few other New England states.
</p>
<a name=""Participant_Selection"" id=""Participant_Selection""></a><h2>Participant Selection</h2>
<p>Participants are invited by public officials. The meetings are open to the general public as well. Some town meetings can be larger then others depending on the location and what issues are on the ballot. The New England Town Meetings are meant to be a place for community members to feel safe and secure in attending and expressing their views.
</p><p>
</p>
<a name=""Outcomes_and_Effects"" id=""Outcomes_and_Effects""></a><h2>Outcomes and Effects</h2>
<p>The New England Town Meetings try to ""ensure that all policy decisions are in the public interest since no intermediaries are placed between the voters and the public decisions."" <a href=""#cite_note-No_Author-0"" title="""">[1]</a> The effect should be to improve one's community by discovering during these meetings what is really needed. Such as, a better education system, public plumbing, or park improvements. 
</p>
<a name=""Examples"" id=""Examples""></a><h2>Examples</h2>
<p>The Massachusette's Open Town Meeting dates back to 1680. This meeting is primarily a local law-making body. ""The development of the finance committee as a valuable adjunct represents the most important change in the town meeting structure in these towns."" <a href=""#cite_note-Zimmerman-4"" title="""">[5]</a> In order for a open town meeting to occur, one must summon a warrant on what to discuss and there is a facilitator present to make sure members stay on track. This ensures the public that the meeting will have a voted outcome at the end.
</p><p>The Vermont Open Town Meeting began in 1777 in Windsor. The outcome of the first meeting was to solve the dispute between New Hampshire and Vermont. ""And whereas the Territory, which now comprehends the State of Vermont, did antecedently of right belong to the government of New Hampshire, and the former Governor, thereof, viz. his excellency Benning Wentworth, Esq. granted many charters of lands and corporations within this State to the present inhabitants and others. And whereas the late Lieutenant-Governor Colden, of New York, with others, did, in violation, of the tenth command, covet those very lands."" <a href=""#cite_note-Zimmerman-4"" title="""">[5]</a> 
</p>
<a name=""Analysis_and_Criticism"" id=""Analysis_and_Criticism""></a><h2>Analysis and Criticism</h2>
<p>To solve the problem of name-calling at town meetings, communities could opt to hold online forums that may reduce the childish content. ""A reporter for the Boston Globe recently found that such sites have profilerated, but may now be falling out of favor."" <a href=""#cite_note-Gastil-2"" title="""">[3]</a>. The online forums could include a larger population than just the New England states and help keep the discussion objective. Other's views would be taken into account on how to better one's community. The more solutions, the better the chance at improvement. On the other hand, this would not ensure that everyone reads and take the other's persons solution into account. The best way to deliberate is to ""create a solid information base, prioritze key values, identify a broad range of solutions, weigh the pros and cons, and make the best decision possible."" <a href=""#cite_note-Gastil-2"" title="""">[3]</a>
</p><p>Another issue that should be addressed in today's problem with low attendance rates. One way to solve this problem, is to promote the meetings in the community where they are held by posting signs and sending emails with inccentives. For example, a $1 raffle could be held at the end of the meeting. A lucky member could win free movie tickets or a discount at the local restaurants. When deliberating on a more social level, community members should be given a brief info session on how to best deliberate. For example, ""adequately distribute ideas and speaking opportunities, ensure mutual comprehension, consider other ideas, and respect other participants."" <a href=""#cite_note-Gastil-2"" title="""">[3]</a>

"<p><a id=""Definition"" name=""Definition""></a></p><h2>Definition</h2><p>Planning cells is a method for deliberation developed by Prof. Dr. Peter C. Dienel, and is designed to be a sort of ""micro-parliament."" In a planning cell, twenty five people from various backgrounds work together to develop a set of solutions to a problem delegated to the participants by a commissioning body. These solutions are then assessed and final recommendations are presented to the commissioning body as a ""Citizen's Report.""</p><p><a id=""Process"" name=""Process""></a></p><h2>Process</h2><p>In order to successfully implement a planning cell, there are several steps that must be taken. First, several people need to be recruited in order to help carry out the planning cell. Duties for recruits include creating the schedule, finding a location to host the cell, identifying experts and interest group representatives who are well-informed on the problem addressed in the cell, and finding citizens to actually participate in the planning cell. The twenty-five participants in the planning cell must be randomly selected and composed of people directly affected by the policy issue and those indirectly affected. Also, participants in a planning cell must be paid for their time, including compensation for participation as well as reimbursement of lost wages. This ensures that members of a planning cell take their job seriously and focus on the cell's objective.</p><p>Once members are organized into a planning cell, a commissioning body (usually a city or county) delegates a problem to the constituents that needs to be addressed. These issues are related to things like government funding, civic programs, and political institutions. Next, in order to tackle the problem given to the planning cell, participants work through three distinct phases.</p><p>In Phase I, citizens' become informed about the issue through a series of lectures, videos, and written pamphlets. During this phase, experts and interest group representatives also have a chance to address the planning cell so that the participants may gain an understanding of the perspectives of all interested parties. Once all of this information is received by the cell members, they may ask questions and seek clarification before entering into Phase II.</p><p>In Phase II, participants process information received in Phase I through group discussions. The 25 person cell is divided into five smaller groups of five people each, and each group is responsible for prioritizing values and identifying criteria to help analyze the problem. During this phase, members are expected to develop a number of recommendations and then choose one to share with the larger group. In order to choose this recommendation, group members rate each decision based on the values they determine to be most important and then vote on their preferred choice.</p><p>In Phase III, the recommendations developed and voted on by each small group are then presented to the larger 25-person assembly. After all participating citizens are made aware of the various solutions, the options are evaluated by the entire group. This evaluation can take many forms. Often, members of the cell will grade or assign points to policy options or vote on various alternatives. Moderators then record these evaluations to develop a final report.</p><p>The final report, created by the moderators of the planning cell, summarizes the results of the cell, provides a description of the procedures followed, and identifies the problem addressed. The initial draft of this report is given to all members of the planning cell first so they may review and make changes if necessary. After edits are made by participants, the final report is then published and presented to the commissioning body.</p><p><a id=""History"" name=""History""></a></p><h2>History</h2><p>The planning cell as a method for deliberation was created by German Prof. Dr. Peter C. Dienel in 1972. Professor Dienel developed the planning cell in response to problems he noticed with the relationship between government officials and ordinary citizens. Noticing an increasing trend in which people did not feel their elected representatives shared the same interests and values as their own, Dienel sought to create a program whereby people could begin to represent themselves. In the past, Dienel noted that public officials had sought to improve relations with citizens by increasing the efficiency of government entities and providing quicker response times when people expressed dissatisfaction with the government. These solutions for Dienel, however, were unsatisfactory and the German professor introduced the method of planning cells to increase the independence of citizens and give them a tool for self-representation. Since the inception of the planning cell in the German town of Schwelm, planning cells have been used over 170 times at more than 40 locations.</p><p><a id=""Case_Studies"" name=""Case_Studies""></a></p><h2>Case Studies</h2><p>Germany</p><p>In August 1982, the German Ministry of Research and Technology utilized planning cells to identify the interests of German citizens in regards to four different energy policy options. The three year study, utilizing 24 separate planning cells in seven communities throughout West Germany, sought to identify the public's preferences for each energy program and the underlying motivations behind those preferences. At the end of the study, researchers found that the planning cells favored the policy option that focused on energy conservation and the efficient use of energy.</p><p>In 1992, the Federal Ministry of Postal Service and Telecommunication commissioned a planning cell to discuss and form recommendations regarding the ""future telephone."" All together 22 planning cells were formed in which 85,000 statements were issued. The final citizen report was given to the ministry and included 66 recommendations that dealt specifically with data protection in telecommunications. Several of these proposals were adopted by the German government.</p><p>Spain</p><p>The Basque Region of Spain has experienced intense ethnic conflict and policy stagnation, but with the help of planning cells was able to successfully resolve a long standing dispute over the construction of a gymnasium in the early 1990's.</p><p>In 1997, the Regional Department of Transportation commissioned 14 planning cells to deliberate the creation of a major highway through the Basque Region. The cells helped evaluate existing plans for the highway, consider alternative routes, and identify the social and political effects of each option.</p><p>United States</p><p>In 1988, the Department of Environmental Protection of New Jersey utilized planning cells to create recommendations for regulating sewage sludge at a Rutgers University research farm. The planning cell used in this case rejected the farm's preference for using the land for sludge application.</p><p><a id=""Evaluation"" name=""Evaluation""></a></p><h2>Evaluation</h2><p>According to Professor Dienel, planning cells are beneficial for individuals participating in the cell, for policy creation, and for society as a whole.</p><p>Individual participants benefit from planning cells because they are empowered in the deliberative process. Planning cells rely on citizens to make decisions and design original solutions to problems. This task requires a large responsibility and leads many to develop a stronger social identity as they evaluate and support their opinions.</p><p>Policy creation is also uniquely aided by planning cells. Because a large part of the process of planning cells involves informing participants about all sides of an issue, citizens are highly competent and knowledgeable when it comes to shaping policies and can foresee the consequences of different legislative options. Also, the random selection of members in a planning cell means that everyone has the opportunity to partake. This results in cells that for the most part mirror the general population and therefore decisions made by the planning cell will most likely be accepted by the people as a whole. Finally, planning cells benefit policy creation because the results of a cell are completely open. Rather than having pre-defined solutions that participants vote on, cells are responsible for creating their own unique policy recommendations. This leaves room for creativity and ingenuity when presenting solutions.</p><p>Society benefits from planning cells because the deliberative method restores trust in democratic institutions. People often complain of a disconnect between government and the general population, and planning cells help to close this gap by giving participants the chance to have power in the decision making process. Also, society may be more willing to accept a policy decision if they know it was created by a group of randomly selected and non-privileged citizens.</p><p>Given these advantages, however, there are also limitations to planning cells as a deliberative method. For one, cells are not adept at resolving issues between different regions or social groups. A group of randomly selected citizens are not skilled in the intricacies of handling intense ethnic or regional conflict. Another issue is accountability. Because planning cell participants are only responsible for designing the decision and not implementing it, the policy options they create may not be financially or physically viable. Also, planning cells are time and resource intensive. Though a typical planning cell lasts 4 to 7 days, they require months of preparation and a great deal of time after the cell adjourns to draft and disseminate a citizen's report. Because of this large time window and the emphasis planning cells put on educating participants, the process can end up costing the organizing body a great deal of money.</p><p><a id=""Reference"" name=""Reference""></a></p><h2>Reference</h2><p>Heesterbeek, Sara, Carolyn J.

<p>Asset-Based Community Development is a communication methodology that utilizes the individual strengths and skills of citizens to build stronger communities and  establish sustainable development. Instead of focusing on solving a specific problem, the ABCD approach focuses on applying individual local assets to problems to create meaningful change. The development is solely community-driven as opposed to being driven by external influences. <a href=""#cite_note-0"" title="""">[1]</a>
</p><p>Created in the 1990's, communities around the world began using the Asset-Based Community Development method. In synergy with other restructuring elements to restore a community, the ABCD method has provided institutions with an approach that is cheap, effective, and avoids personal dependence. Methodologies that originate at the civic level can empower members of a community to action. <a href=""#cite_note-1"" title="""">[2]</a>
</p>
<a name=""Process"" id=""Process""></a><h2>Process</h2>
<p>The ABCD self-mobilization process has guidelines for achieving a strong level of community-driven development. These guidelines assist the participant in organizing a group as well as mapping the capacities of the community. Variations of this process exist for the use of different NGOs. <a href=""#cite_note-2"" title="""">[3]</a>
</p><p>
Step 1: Collecting Stories
</p><p>Conducting informal discussions and interviews can provide a forum for citizens to express their experiences from past endeavors. This discussion has a dual effect; not only does it reveal unrealized assets, but it also helps build confidence in a person's personal abilities. This confidence will evoke the motivation to contribute to the sustainable community development process. 
</p><p>Step 2: Organizing a Core Group 
</p><p>As the process of collecting stories continues, certain participants will be distinguishable from the rest as leaders. These committed individuals may have shown leadership aptitude in the past, or they may currently be in a position of authority. Organizing the leaders of the group and compelling them to further explore the assets of the community is of importance. These leaders will network and build relationships with other individuals in the community.
</p><p>Step 3: Mapping Completely the Capacities and Assets of Individuals, Associations, and Local Institutions
</p><p>Mapping is an extensive process conducted by citizens themselves; the mapping process helps participants learn more about the talents of other community members and will identity links between different assets. Mapping is more complicated than merely collecting data; a large part of the mapping process is in developing new relationships amongst community members. 
	During the mapping processes, one should have an outline to ensure the following: 
</p><p>
Identifying associations-  These associations are the backbone of community action and are essential as assets. The associations should be listed by type and those most likely to work together for a common goal should be identified.
</p><p>Identifying individual gifts, skills, and capacities- Every participant should feel as if their gift has been realized and is appreciated. The capacities of each person is placed in categories such as “community-building skills”, “teaching skills”, “artistic skills.” Other organizations may choose to categorize by skills of the heart, head, and hand.
</p><p>Identifying the assets of local institutions- Assets of institutions could be found in the services they provide, the equipment they have, or the communication links they may provide. 
</p><p>Identifying physical assets and natural resources- Natural resources such as land, water, or other resources should be identified as either privately managed or community owned and managed. 
</p><p>Mapping the local economy- How does the economy work? What resources can be realized for maximum community benefit. Could imported products be produced locally? 
</p><p>
Step 4: Convening a Broad Representative Group to Build a Community Vision and Plan
</p><p>In this step, the central organized theme is matched with different assets. The decisions should be made by those identified as leaders in the earlier steps. 
</p><p>Step 5: Mobilizing Assets for Community Development
</p><p>In this step, the processes are initiated as the community assets are mobilized.  Further associations are encouraged to engage those with similar interests. Looking for common ground amongst participants and encouraging contribution is necessary. 
</p><p>Step 6: Leveraging Activities, Investments and Resources from Outside the Community to Support Asset-Based, Locally Defined Development
</p><p>Before external resources are tapped, all local resources must be utilized. This would put the community in a position of strength for furthering the vision.

<a name=""History"" id=""History""></a><h2>History</h2>
<p>The ABCD methodology was created by John McKnight and Jody Kretzmann at the Institute for Policy Research at Northwestern University. In their co-authored book released in 1993, Building Communities from the Inside Out, they outline an alternative approach to the needs-based approach used by poor communities. This process empowers communities to “assemble their strengths into new combinations, new structures of opportunity, new sources of income and control, and new possibilities for production."" <a href=""#cite_note-3"" title="""">[4]</a> 
</p><p>In the United States, several communities have mobilized to utilize the ABCD approach to improve economic and social development. In Savannah George, the community transitioned their responsibilities from being consumers of services to producers of community. This gradual shift to mobilization demonstrates that individual resources are often unrealized in a community. The key to ABDC is in the ability of local relationships to drive community development. The strength of these associations can be connected to each other in ways that multiply their effectiveness. <a href=""#cite_note-4"" title="""">[5]</a>
</p>
<a name=""Case_Studies"" id=""Case_Studies""></a><h2>Case Studies</h2>
<p>ABCD is becoming a more popular strategy for community based development. Current strategies draw from this methodology, including the sustainable livelihood approaches developed by the Department for International Development and the asset building framework employed by Ford.
</p><p>The Mercado Central was developed by Latino immigrants in Minneapolis as a retail business cooperative; the community worked together with many organizations and faith-based groups to build a traditional marketplace in their inner-city neighborhood. The market has transformed the community through both its existence as well as the benefits of the process itself. 
</p><p>The Greater Rochester Health Foundation launched the Neighborhood Health Status Improvement Program in 2008. This program partners with the ABCD institute and focuses on working to improve the health status of the residents of the community. Five individual projects focus on local issues, such as housing, economic concerns, the environment, and promoting social interaction. This organization has proven effective at mobilizing local residents toward improving community health.
</p><p>By 1995, Seattle's historic Columbia City district was overrun with prostitutes and drug dealers. Recognizing that something had to be done, residents and businesses formed the Columbia City Revitalization Committee. Participants were asked to think of a project that could improve the area; each idea was written on a piece of paper and the papers were posted at the front of the room. Each cluster of ideas was assigned to a meeting place. The participants then continued the discussion that most appealed to them. The result was the launching of new community projects. The community's vision and use of resources has resulted in businesses moving back into the area. Today, no store fronts are still vacant.<a href=""#cite_note-5"" title="""">[6]</a>
</p>
<a name=""Evaluation"" id=""Evaluation""></a><h2>Evaluation</h2>
<p>The ABCD faces numerous further challenges. The real danger exists that the methodology will be discredited as being used as a self-serving initiative for  private agencies. Avoiding dependency on the external agency facilitating the process is a major concern. As communities become larger and a greater network of connections are made, central control can be reduced. Reducing this dependency is a consistent problem in the ABCD method. 
</p><p>Certain environments may not be conducive to the ABCD method. The method may be difficult to enact in hostile environments or places where social hierarchies marginalize certain people. Furthermore, anticipating how the social change will affect the community can help protect the growth of associations.

"<p>“The public hearing is perhaps the most widespread venue for public participation in the United States, used by all levels of government for a variety of purposes.”<a href=""#cite_note-karpowitz-0"" title="""">[1]</a>
</p>

<a name=""Definition"" id=""Definition""></a><h2> Definition </h2>
<p>A public hearing is a type of public meeting, and much literature refers to it as such, however there are some distinctive aspects that make a hearing different. Abigail Williamson and Archon Fung define a public hearing as “an open gathering of officials and citizens, in which citizens are permitted to offer comments, but officials are not obliged to act on them or, typically, even to respond publicly.”<a href=""#cite_note-williamson-1"" title="""">[2]</a> The main purpose of a public hearing is to allow citizens the chance to voice opinions and concerns over a decision facing a legislature, agency, or organization. 
</p><p>Most public hearings are held by local or state governments and government agencies, such as the US EPA or California Coastal Commission, as well as local organizations such as a school PTA. More than 97% of local governments hold public hearings, and this high percentage is largely because under most state and federal laws, government agencies are required to hold public hearings before making a final decision that will use government funds and effect the general public.<a href=""#cite_note-karpowitz-0"" title="""">[1]</a> However, even though public hearings are typically required by law, the agency or organization is not required to base their decision on the views and issues presented at the hearing, rather the hearing is a simply a chance for citizens to share opinions. 
</p><p>Public hearings can also be referred to as public inquiries, and “are seen to legitimize controversial decisions taken in several important areas of governmental planning activity.”<a href=""#cite_note-forester-2"" title="""">[3]</a> Hearings give citizens a chance to contribute to the discussion over decisions made by the officials, and as Karpowitz states, “common public hearings are critical institutions for public voice.""<a href=""#cite_note-karpowitz-0"" title="""">[1]</a>
</p>
<a name=""Process"" id=""Process""></a><h2> Process </h2>
<p>A public hearing is typically held when a government, government agency, or organization is making a decision on a course of action, such as a law or plan for construction. The hearing is organized and held by the government agency or organization in the area where the issue will take place and have the greatest effect. Sometimes it is well publicized in the local media, while other times it is barely mentioned, and the level of publicity mostly depends on the amount of controversy surrounding the issue. The level of publicity, in turn, determines how well attended the hearing will be, ranging from auditoriums full of concerned citizens to a small room with only the officials. For most hearings, the agency holding the hearing must notify all the parties they believe to be interested and effected by the outcome of the decision.<a href=""#cite_note-williamson-1"" title="""">[2]</a> The public hearing is then made open to the public, and participants are self-selected individuals as well as the representatives from the government agency or organization. In addition, sometimes experts from fields relevant to the issue will be asked to present information and answer questions.
</p><p>The structure of each public hearing varies depending on the specifications made by the organizing group, however a typical hearing begins with statements and presentations made by the officials presiding over the hearing. In addition, at the beginning there is typically a presentation of the technical aspects, especially for issues that center around planning, such as construction of a bridge. These presentations are then followed by a period for public comments and questions.<a href=""#cite_note-williamson-1"" title="""">[2]</a> The citizens comments are limited in time, for example two minutes, with a period usually established at the beginning of the hearing. Citizens typically approach a microphone and/or podium, and present facing the officials with backs to the citizen audience.<a href=""#cite_note-williamson-1"" title="""">[2]</a>
</p><p>As Williamson and Fung explain, the type of relationship between the citizens who attend the public hearing and the agency or organization that is making the final decision can be classified in two categories: informational and consultation. The informational aspect is because the officials at the hearing are given a chance to explain the proposed action and answer citizen’s questions on the issue. A hearing is also a consultation, because citizens and outside experts are typically invited to give opinions and suggest alternative solutions to the officials who will make the final decision.<a href=""#cite_note-williamson-1"" title="""">[2]</a>
</p>
<a name=""History"" id=""History""></a><h2> History </h2>
<p>According to Forester, the use of public hearings began following the process of the enclosure of public lands that occurred in Britain in the 18th and 19th centuries. At the beginning of the enclosure process, for each plot of land that was going to be enclosed, a separate act of Parliament was required. Public meetings were held in order to create a petition to parliament to enclose the land, and later to hear objections to the act created by Parliament. These public meetings were resided over by a commission, who were bound by impartiality. The commissioners were originally assigned, however, in later years there was at least one who was publicly appointed. In 1845, the General Inclosure Act created permanent commissioners who sent all bills to Parliament, and one publicly appointed commissioner who resided over the public meetings to hear citizen concerns. This use of commissions to hear public concerns over the enclosure of lands was one of the first examples of a public hearing, and emphasizes how most public hearings today are used when dealing with public lands as well as private properties.<a href=""#cite_note-forester-2"" title="""">[3]</a>

<a name=""Deliberative_Aspects"" id=""Deliberative_Aspects""></a><h3>Deliberative Aspects</h3>
<p>While many officials and citizens cringe at the idea of holding or attending a public hearing, there are many aspects that make it a good example of a deliberative process. First, by allowing citizens to present their views on issues, officials are able to get a better sense of the public support or opposition to a particular issue.<a href=""#cite_note-williamson-1"" title="""">[2]</a> Even though officials may or may not ultimately be swayed in their decision by these public comments, the hearing allows citizens the chance to feel as though their voice was heard. The chance to speak can also provide an opportunity for citizens to “change the behavior of their elected representatives by providing information, making a show of support, delaying decisions, shaming, and agenda setting.”<a href=""#cite_note-karpowitz-0"" title="""">[1]</a> In addition, while the time constraint of the public hearing can limit some voices, it allows for the equal opportunity of all view points to be presented, without one person dominating the discussion at any time.<a href=""#cite_note-karpowitz-0"" title="""">[1]</a> This equality can also provide a greater opportunity for minority opinions to be heard by the officials. However, one of the greatest benefits of a public hearing is allowing a face-to-face discussion of different sides of an issue, especially between elected officials and citizens. The public hearing is an opportunity for citizens to communicate with those making decisions in a process other than simply voting on a ballot or sending an email.
</p>
<a name=""Anti-Deliberative_Aspects"" id=""Anti-Deliberative_Aspects""></a><h3>Anti-Deliberative Aspects</h3>
<p>However, although the ideal public hearing would have those deliberative aspects outlined above, that is usually not the case, and much of the literature published on the subject has outlined three major issues with public hearings. The first problem with public hearings is timing, since most hearings are held later in the decision-making process. (Webler and Renn) This timing invites more complaints from citizens, rather than a discussion of pros and cons, and causes those citizens to “perceive that those ‘hearing’ their input have already chose to ignore it.”<a href=""#cite_note-gastil-3"" title="""">[4]</a> The second problem is the structure of the meeting. Citizens are usually only able to give brief statements, which does not provide the appropriate speaking time to develop different opinions. The “testimonial format” does not give a chance for citizens to develop and exchange ideas and solutions, and instead causes them to “take on the role of activists advocating their cause.”<a href=""#cite_note-karpowitz-0"" title="""">[1]</a> In addition, because most public hearings are held by government agencies for things such as planning or construction, the conversation can be technical, making it difficult for those who are not experts in the field to understand the discussion.<a href=""#cite_note-gastil-3"" title="""">[4]</a> A third problem that was exposed in a study by Cook, Delli Carpini, and Jocobs found that the percentage of the public that attends public meetings is only at 25%.<a href=""#cite_note-carpini-4"" title="""">[5]</a> Similarly, the majority of people who attend the meetings tend to be more educated and wealthy, leading to a disproportionate representation of view points. As Williamson argues, those who attend public meetings tend to be those with the most interest and economic stake in the outcome of the decision. Furthermore, those who speak tend to be those with the most intense opinions, whereas most people who attend a hearing do not speak at all. This sometimes disproportionately high level of extreme positions can make it difficult to arrive at any kind of consensus.<a href=""#cite_note-karpowitz-0"" title="""">[1]</a> However, as Karpowitz also points out, there have been numerous studies that have shown contradictory findings, or no statistically significant findings at all, about the type of view points that are present at hearings.
</p>
<a name=""Suggested_Improvements"" id=""Suggested_Improvements""></a><h3>Suggested Improvements</h3>
<p>In Karpowitz discussion on public hearings, he outlines two improvements tat could be implemented to help hearings become more deliberative. First, he suggests that all hearings begin with a welcome statement by the officials presiding over the hearing, acknowledging all the groups present. By recognizing the different view points, people will feel more comfortable talking, and may encourage more viewpoints to be discussed. In addition, if the officials acknowledge the parties present, those who are speaking are more likely to feel as though the officials are really listening to what they have to say. The second suggestion is to allow more time for the officials to respond to the comments made by citizens. Instead of just a brief, “Thank you,” if officials respond to each comment, it will foster a better discussion, moving away from the advocacy feel of the hearing.<a href=""#cite_note-karpowitz-0"" title="""">[1]</a>

"<p> </p><p><a id=""The_Imperative_Significance_To_Consensus_Conferences"" name=""The_Imperative_Significance_To_Consensus_Conferences""></a></p><h3>Main Idea and Significance:</h3><p>The public’s opinion and support behind significant topics in specified fields is essential to deriving a common good for society. The ideology protruding behind consensus conferences redefines the path to arrive at a public good. A consensus conference can be defined as, “a chaired public hearing with an audience from the public and with active participation of 10-15 people, referred to as the jury or panel, and a corresponding number of different experts.” (cefic). Essentially, Consensus Conferences are a meeting held in order to represent the average society member’s view on scientific technology. The overriding goal striving to be achieved is to connect the average day citizen in a community to the ideas and advancements in scientific technology. Many people do not understand the science behind new medical technology and the potential advantages and harmful drawbacks. On the same hand as informing the public, Consensus Conferences attempt to portray an equilibrium by receiving the public’s opinions on what qualifies and what deems too harmful.</p><p> </p><h3>Consensus Conference History and Examples:</h3><p>Consensus Conferences were created in the United States in the 1960’s, and were initially hindered toward resolving biomedical technology. These conferences were first utilized by the United States regarding the assessment of the health care sector. In recent years Consensus Conferences have been further developed by the Danish Board of Technologies. The tactic of Consensus Conferences has represented many successful attempts and resulted in positive effects across the world. However has been highly concentrated in the United States and Denmark. One example of a Consensus Conference that resulted in outstanding feedback took place in the United Kingdom under Edward Andersson. This conference was held in May of 1999 and represented the publics’ outlook on radioactive waste management. A random sample of 15 participants focused on “the effective and publicly acceptable long-term management of nuclear waste in the UK, both civil and military, concentrating particularly on intermediate and high level waste.” (People and Participation). The panel and experts followed the steps of the process and arrived to a solid form of deliberation. The Consensus Conference resulted in a copious amount of more informed citizens on the topic of radioactive waste and the situation at hand in their society. Just as well as the United Kingdom’s radioactive waste management Consensus Conference, this policy has been utilized by Denmark for technologies, Australia for Gene technology and the use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV infected adults, and the United States for the National Institutes of Health (NIH).</p><p> </p><h3>Consensus Conference Process:</h3><p>The processes undergoing this forum, begins with a panel of randomly selected citizens that research and construct questions in order to present to experts on the date of the conference. This process of researching involves examination of a pamphlet provided as well as attending preparatory events. The next step involves the group of participants to construct their presentation to the experts. The ideology behind this step demonstrates the ability of the group to decided what will be discussed in the debate as well as which witnesses will be contributing. This form of construction enables the general public to determine which aspects of the novel technology demand attention. Preceding the panel’s decisions, normally lasting two weeks, a conference is held where the press and public are allowed to be present. A head organizer, otherwise known as a facilitator, oversees the conference ensuring that deliberation resides on track and pertains appropriate. Post the conclusion of the conference, the panel construes a report outlining the conclusions and recommendations which are then circulated to key players regarding the organization at hand and the media. The organization and outlay of the Consensus Conference steps is essential to deriving strong deliberation and hearing the public’s voice. The strategy of this style of deliberation demonstrates an optimal path to uncovering a common good.</p><p> </p><h3>Consensus Conference Times of Use:</h3><p>In contrast to how a Consensus Conference operates, there are many different situations and times that this type of deliberation should be utilized and others when it does not fulfill the requirements. Consensus Conferences function at their most optimal prime involving controversial issues at a National level and with subjects that deem complex or are expert dominated. These types of discrepancies perform preeminent because they enable the delivery of views of informed average citizens to other general public citizens in a language suitable. Other citizens will be able to regurgitate the material and will result in a better informed public on the debate at hand. In conclusion, Consensus Conferences enable a complex matter to be broken down into a more generalized form that can be presented by the media to update citizens that do not contain an in depth knowledge in the subject. Differing from perfect Consensus Conference topics, this form of deliberation and informative material should not be exploited when the issue is uncontroversial, contains biased participants, or when the panel is expected to create actual decisions. Consensus Conferences are not intended to derive decisions, make detailed technical recommendations, or be read as a representation of a whole society.</p><p> </p><h3>References:</h3><p>People and Participation: Summary of the method of Consensus Conferences: <a class=""external free"" href=""http://www.peopleandparticipation.net/display/Methods/Consensus+Conference"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""http://www.peopleandparticipation.net/display/Methods/Consensus+Conference"">http://www.peopleandparticipation.net/display/Methods/Consensus+Conference</a></p><p>People and Participation: Example of United Kingdom Consensus Conference: <a class=""external free"" href=""http://www.peopleandparticipation.net/display/CaseStudies/Consensus+Conference+on+radioactive+waste+management"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""http://www.peopleandparticipation.net/display/CaseStudies/Consensus+Conference+on+radioactive+waste+management"">http://www.peopleandparticipation.net/display/CaseStudies/Consensus+Conference+on+radioactive+waste+management</a></p><p>Co-intelligence Institute: Danish Board of Technologies form of Consensus Conferences: <a class=""external free"" href=""http://www.co-intelligence.org/P-ConsensusConference1.html"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""http://www.co-intelligence.org/P-ConsensusConference1.html"">http://www.co-intelligence.org/P-ConsensusConference1.html</a></p><p>Wikipedia Organization: Summary and Examples of Consensus Conferences: <a class=""external free"" href=""http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:mii0CdwM0aQJ:en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_decision-making+Consensus+Conference+Example&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:mii0CdwM0aQJ:en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_decision-making+Consensus+Conference+Example&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us"">http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:mii0CdwM0aQJ:en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_decision-making+Consensus+Conference+Example&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us</a></p><p>Epress Education Organization: History and Examples of Consensus Conferences: <a class=""external free"" href=""http://epress.anu.edu.au/dialogue_methods/mobile_devices/ch03s02.html"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""http://epress.anu.edu.au/dialogue_methods/mobile_devices/ch03s02.html"">http://epress.anu.edu.au/dialogue_methods/mobile_devices/ch03s02.html</a></p><p> </p><h3>Suggested Readings on Consensus Conferences:</h3><p>Joss, S. and Durant, J.

"<h3>Definition</h3><p>The initiative process is a form of <a href=""http://participedia.net/methods/direct-democracy"">direct democracy</a>. Two types of initiative process are widely in use today.  The first is called citizens’ initiative or popular initiative (hereinafter, “citizens’ initiative”). In the citizens’ initiative process, citizens draft a legislative bill or constitutional amendment (a “measure”), which they then propose by petition; if the petition receives sufficient popular support, the measure is then placed on the ballot and can be enacted into law by a direct vote of citizens.  Some citizens’ initiative processes allow the government to make a counter-proposal to the measure; the government’s counterproposal appears on the ballot with the measure.</p><p>The second type of initiative process is called agenda initiative or agenda-setting initiative (hereinafter “agenda initiative”). In the agenda-initiative process, citizens draft a proposed law or policy (a “measure”), which they then propose by petition; if the petition receives sufficient popular support, the measure is submitted to the legislature, which decides whether to enact or implement the measure. In some agenda-initiative processes, citizens may also participate -- by consultation or referendum -- after the measure has been submitted to the legislature.</p><h3>Problems and Purpose</h3><p>Initiative processes are intended to solve the problem – arising in many democracies -- of governmental action (or inaction) that is inconsistent with the will of most citizens and that cannot be resolved by elections.</p><p>Many factors may cause a government’s policies to fail to align with citizens’ preferences in a way that elections cannot resolve; these include corruption; government officials’ self-interest; ineffective legislative procedures; excessive partisanship among legislators;  social, economic, or cultural differences between government officials and citizens; low rates of voter turnout; lack of government transparency; and the influence of popular movements.</p><p>Where the citizens’ initiative has been implemented, if the government acts in a manner inconsistent with most citizens’ preferences or declines to implement a policy that most citizens prefer citizens may bypass the government and directly enact the laws they wish. Where the agenda initiative has been implemented, citizens may compel an unresponsive government to consider a law or policy that enjoys strong popular support.</p><h3>History</h3><p>The initiative process appears to have originated in Switzerland.  Most Swiss cantons began to use the citizens’ initiative between 1845 and 1869.</p><p>In 1893 the U.S. state of California implemented citizens’ initiatives at the county level, and in 1898 the California cities of Vallejo and San Francisco adopted the citizens’ initiative.  As of 1911 the citizens’ initiative was being used at the municipal level in 19 U.S. states.  Several U.S. states – with South Dakota being the first in 1898 -- implemented the citizens’ initiative process at the state level during the Progressive Era. By 1918 nineteen U.S. states had authorized use of the state-level citizens’ initiative.</p><p>In the U.S. as of 2012 twenty-seven states have implemented the citizens’ initiative at the state level and about 50% of all municipalities, including 80% of the largest cities, have implemented the citizens’ initiative.  In the 1950s and 1960s the number of state-level citizens’ initiatives appearing on ballots declined in the U.S.  The number of state-level citizens’ initiatives appearing on ballots in the U.S. has risen since the 1970s and a total of 159 citizens' initiatives were voted on in the U.S. in 2010.</p><p>In Europe as of 2012 ten countries appear to have adopted the citizens’ initiative at the national level and 13 appear to have adopted the agenda initiative at the national level. At least 9 European countries have implemented the citizens’ initiative at the local level. Further, the European Union has implemented the <a href=""http://ec.europa.eu/citizens-initiative/"">European Citizens’ Initiative</a>, which, despite its name, is an agenda initiative.</p><p>In the Asia-Pacific region as of 2012 five nations seem to have authorized use of the citizens’ initiative at the national level.</p><p>In Africa as of 2012 Kenya and Uganda appear to have implemented the citizens’ initiative at the national level, and Botswana, Cape Verde, and Uganda appear to have implemented the agenda initiative at the national level.</p><p>In Latin America as of 2012 six nations seem to have implemented the citizens’ initiative at the national level and 4 at the regional or local level.  Eleven nations seem to have implemented the agenda initiative at the national level and 3 at the regional or local level.</p><h3>Deliberation, Decisions, and Public Interaction</h3><p>In most jurisdictions that have implemented the initiative process, no formal deliberation about initiatives occurs. One exception is the U.S. state of Oregon, which has implemented the <a href=""http://participedia.net/methods/citizens-initiative-review"">Citizens’ Initiative Review</a> – a <a href=""http://participedia.net/methods/citizens-jury"">Citizens’ Jury</a> that deliberates about a citizens’ initiative – as part of its official statewide citizens’ initiative process.  The Oregon process is called the <a href=""http://participedia.net/cases/oregon-citizens-initiative-review-oregon-cir"">Oregon Citizens’ Initiative Review</a>.</p><p>In the absence of a formal deliberative process, citizens rely on several different sources of information  to gather information for their informal deliberations and decision making about initiatives. </p><p>In many jurisdictions that have implemented the citizens’ initiative, the government distributes to voters information about initiatives on the ballot in a booklet called a voters’ guide or voters’ pamphlet (hereinafter a “voters’ guide”). In some jurisdictions civil society organizations also produce unofficial voters’ guides providing information about initiatives.</p><p>Citizens may use the information about initiatives appearing in voters’ guides during informal deliberations and decision making about ballot initiatives.</p><p>In some jurisdictions that have implemented the initiative process, advocates supporting or opposing an initiative may distribute information and arguments about initiatives through political campaigns, which may involve advertising, other kinds of promotional materials, op-ed articles in news media, Internet marketing, social media marketing, mass media appearances, and public events.</p><p>In some jurisdictions, when an initiative of great public interest is being circulated or will appear on the ballot news organizations or civil society organizations may hold forums – on mass media, on the Internet, or at public meeting places -- at which citizens may learn more about the initiative and hear advocates’ arguments supporting or opposing the initiative. </p><p>Research suggests that voters often receive inadequate information about initiatives.  Some surveys show that voters have low levels of awareness and knowledge of initiatives. In the U.S. initiatives are frequently invalidated by courts on the grounds that the initiatives conflict with constitutional or other law; this suggests that voters often receive inadequate information about the legal aspects of initiatives. Further, the language of initiatives and voters’ guides frequently exceeds the reading ability of most voters, and campaign advertisements about initiatives often contain false or misleading claims. This evidence suggests the initiative processes in many jurisdictions could be improved by increasing the quality of information citizens receive about initiatives.</p><p>Research also shows that in some circumstances initiative processes have led to good decisions. These include the enactment of initiatives that benefit most citizens but are inconsistent with the interests of incumbent legislators, such as initiatives that create new and effective governmental bodies or that impose taxation caps or term limits.  Research also shows that initiative processes may benefit citizens by increasing citizens’ participation in politics as well as citizens' sense of empowerment.</p><h3>Secondary Sources</h3><p>Shaun Bowler and Todd Donovan.

"<p>The Oregon Health Decisions organization's method provides the opportunity for residents of Oregon from all ethnic, religious, and social backgrounds to get involved in the state's health care policy choices while being educated simultaneously on health care polices through citizen's assembly and community forums. From this method, Oregonians are able to depict their health care desires to the state government for consideration, allowing for the government to make legislative decisions based off of the wants and needs of the people of Oregon. The Oregon Health Decisions efforts correlate with helping low-income households select the most appropriate Medicaid plan that suit them.

"<h3>Definition</h3><p>University Student Governments serve as the official voice for students in University affairs and to external organizations. When students are brought to the table in the Universities’ decision-making process it ensures multiple voices are being heard and gives validity to the decisions and innovations of the Administration. For many institutions their student government have had an executive board, legislative body, and students serve as representatives to University Committees and Faculty Councils.<a href=""#cite_note-0"" title="""">[1]</a>. Student leaders serve the interests of their fellow students at their institution, working with them to create and continue measures, policies, and programs that further student life and higher education.</p><p><a id=""Purpose_and_Process"" name=""Purpose_and_Process""></a></p><h2>Purpose and Process</h2><p>Student Government serves as the liaison “between students and local, state, and even federal governments, NGOs like the chamber of commerce, and other University constituencies” <a href=""#cite_note-1"" title="""">[2]</a>. Student leaders get involved to serve their community and for career preparation. Student Government gives the Administration a group to poll student opinion and the student government is able to quickly mobilize students on issues of student interest. Student governments deliberate on problems pertaining to academics and on campus issues, work towards a solution, and then bring that solution to the faculty and the student body.</p><p>There are five types of student governments. 1.) Community Government A community government has representative from across the University serving as representatives; this includes faculty, students, and staff. 2.) Student Council This body is charged with representing the entire student body. It is a small council, removed from students. In this instance it can be difficult to get a good voter turnout and constituents don’t see the impact of their vote. With a smaller student government it is less likely that diversity and different viewpoints are represented. 3.) Organizational Council Representatives elected from their individual registered student organizations and living situations (Greek, Residence Halls, Commuters) sit on the council. A flaw in the Organization Council is that it is not a democratic body, not all groups represent and communicate with students. 4.) Bicameral This type of student government has executive and legislative powers and a larger assembly that deals with legislation. There are checks and balances between the two bodies. 5.) The Student Association Students become members by paying the student activity fee and being a member connects students with the Student Government. <a href=""#cite_note-2"" title="""">[3]</a>.</p><p><a id=""History"" name=""History""></a></p><h2>History</h2><p>In the middle ages the idea of student government in Universities was created. Student government was brought to the United States in 1779 when it was established at the College of William and Mary <a href=""#cite_note-3"" title="""">[4]</a> Thomas Jefferson advocated for instituting student government at the University of Virginia to educate participants in citizenship. <a href=""#cite_note-4"" title="""">[5]</a>. There was an increase of student governments in the 20th century as University administrators created them to better their communication with students. The University of Washington student government began in 1886 by the initiative of President Harrington <a href=""#cite_note-5"" title="""">[6]</a>. There was another resurgence in the interest of student government at the end of WWII as students asked “for non-traditional services, such as married student housing, and evening course offerings.” <a href=""#cite_note-6"" title="""">[7]</a>. In the 1960s and 70s due to the sexual revolution and the Vietnam War there was widespread activism in Universities. The increase in student activism and involvement in student government was the catalyst to the changes students spearheaded by persuading faculty and administrators to recognize drastic changes needed to be made in their University and the curriculum. <a href=""#cite_note-7"" title="""">[8]</a>. Student Governments have evolved over the years with one basic goal in mind, to serve students and represent their interests.</p><p><a id=""Case_Studies"" name=""Case_Studies""></a></p><h2>Case Studies</h2><p>See ASUW Student Senate</p><p><a id=""Evaluation"" name=""Evaluation""></a></p><h2>Evaluation</h2><p>A successful Student Government effectively communicates with students using a variety of resources including; social media, school newspaper, word of mouth, and programming. Having one on one interactions with students, or having a legislative body that establishes student opinion ensures the executive branch of the Student Government is well informed about student needs and priorities. Two-way communication and a representative legislative body gives student government the tools to be a deliberative body. The legislative body brings different individuals to the table to discuss solutions to problems, weigh the solutions, prioritize the issues, and then choose the best solution.</p><p>Student governments can be great for the students they serve, but can fall into a variety of pitfalls. They can become a single idea interest group, representing one group, political party, or ideology. The best student governments have individuals from different socio-economic backgrounds, majors, and living situations as participants. <a href=""#cite_note-8"" title="""">[9]</a>. Another pitfall is that the student government becomes a rubber stamp for the Administration. This means that instead of serving students the student government becomes a tool for the Administration and the student leaders fail to accomplish significant victories for those they serve. Another drawback is student apathy. In a survey at Akdeniz University 90% of those surveyed didn’t know who their student representative was. <a href=""#cite_note-9"" title="""">[10]</a>. At the University of Washington there has been a consistent low voter turnout, this year there was a 13% voter turnout. Successful student groups actively seek out other students opinions, educate them on the activities of the student government, and try to get the campus to be a part of deliberative discussions on student issues.</p><p><a id=""Notes"" name=""Notes""></a></p><h2>Notes</h2><ol class=""references""><li id=""cite_note-0""><a href=""#cite_ref-0"" title="""">↑</a> Miller, Michael T., and Daniel P.

"<a name=""Definition"" id=""Definition""></a><h2>Definition</h2>
<p>The World Café defines itself as “a conversational process based on a set of integrated design principles that reveal a deeper living network pattern through which we co-evolve our collective future” <a href=""#cite_note-0"" title="""">[1]</a>  It is a methodology for hosting conversations about relevant questions and themes.  The ideal is that there are multiple conversations that build off of each other to explore the issue deeply. Participants of World Cafes are encouraged to draw from their own lives, values, and personal experiences so the group can learn from and connect with each other based on these things.  An overall goal is for participants to realize or create a shared purpose and goals.  
</p><p>In reality, a World Café can have as many or as few participants as the host(s) want, whether that is only a handful of people or thousands.  The cost of a World Café is only as much as the host(s) would like to spend; generally the costs are those of the materials needed/desired at the World Café such as table cloths, markers, paper, name tags, food and drink.  And because literally anyone can hold a World Café they all look different, are held by different organizations and people, and have different goals and purposes.
</p>
<a name=""Process"" id=""Process""></a><h2>Process</h2>
<p>Anyone can host a World Café, all you need is a purpose, participants, and a meeting place.  The host(s) must first define the purpose and who is invited to their World Café, name their Café appropriately and send invitations to the guests on their list.  The next step is creating a hospitable space, welcoming your guests, and defining the purpose of the World Café to the group.  The World Café should be organized into groups of four or five people per table rotating from table to table between three (or so) twenty to thirty minute conversational rounds.  There should be progressively deeper questions, ideas, and/or themes to explore at each round and they should be clearly stated/posted to keep the conversations on track.  A table host should be stationed at each table that will stay there for all of the rounds and summarize each groups findings to the next group to learn from and build off of.  At the end of the conversational rounds, groups should have some time to summarize their key findings and then present them to the entire group at the end.  Next, the group as a whole convenes to connect all of the ideas into just a few shared key points.  The most helpful guide to holding a successful World Café is to follow the six design principles. <a href=""#cite_note-1"" title="""">[2]</a>
</p>
<a name=""Design_principles"" id=""Design_principles""></a><h2>Design principles</h2>
<p>1. Set the Context: Have a clear idea of the “what” and “why” of the meeting. Envision ideal outcomes and try to figure out how you can direct the café toward those outcomes.  What is the topic of your World Cafe? Who should participate? How much time (how many days) do you have to discuss the issue? 
</p><p>2. Create a Hospitable Space: A café ambiance, with comfortable seating and soft lighting to create a relaxed, social setting, will encourage comfortable, productive discussion. Multiple tables scattered around the room covered with brightly colored tablecloths, small floral centerpieces, and coloring supplies, as well as some soft background music, are all encouraged to create a hospitable space. Maybe serve food and refreshments to make the setting more social in order to invite conversation. And, of course, make sure the environment is also socially comfortable – people feel comfortable to speak freely and openly. 
</p><p>Since the invitation helps to create the setting, the World Café suggests sending out colorful invitations with plenty of graphics to set a familial tone.  The invitation should also include the central theme or question to be explored.   
</p><p>3. Explore questions that matter: The central questions or themes of discussions should be relevant to the actual concerns of the people present at the meeting. The depth of the question a World Café takes on may depend on the amount of time available; less time may allow for the exploration of only one simple question while more time could allow more, deeper exploration of a question through several rounds of discussion.  The World Café has come up with some helpful guidelines for good questions to explore; the question should: be clear and simple, provoke thought, generate energy, open new possibilities, invite deep reflection, and seek useful insight. <a href=""#cite_note-2"" title="""">[3]</a>
</p><p>The way in which the question is posed can be crucial to the outcome of the discussion.  According to David Cooperrider, posing a question in a way to provoke the ideal discussion dynamic and inquiry outcome is called “appreciative inquiry.” Instead of asking definitive questions like “who is to blame for the problem,” appreciative inquiry indicates asking exploratory questions that encourage participants to explore different possibilities according to their own personal lives and values. It is also important to a World Café discussion to ensure that each participant shares their own values and personal definitions of key concepts such as “truth” so the collective group can explore the issue in a shared light.  
</p><p>4. Encourage Everyone’s contribution: An effective World Café includes various viewpoints and life situations so multiple aspects of an issue can be brought up and discussed.  The goal of World Café is to connect a diverse group of citizens so that participants can share new intelligence and ideas with one another.  In order to ensure that every participant is allowed equal speaking opportunity, a “talking object” should be placed on the table and passed from speaker to speaker.  The idea of this object is that only one person at a time may have the object, so only one person at a time may speak, and the rest of the group must listen intently to whoever has the floor.  The speaker is expected to stay focused on the topic at hand and to clearly express their thoughts while the listeners are expected to listen with an open, appreciative mind and to allow themselves to be swayed.  
</p><p>5. Connect diverse perspectives: Here is where those coloring supplies can come in handy; creating a shared space on the table for participants to literally draw the accumulating ideas can help them mentally draw connections between differing viewpoints and ideas.  Also, there should be a number of conversational rounds with short breaks in-between for participants to change tables so the discussion can really be diverse and, eventually, lead to a deep web of connections.  Every new round will bring new ideas and connections which can be drawn from in succeeding rounds to encourage deeper and more meaningful discussion with every new round. With one person fixed at each round to summarize previous conversations, the conversation rounds can be even more effective by allowing so much information to be drawn from and connected to.
</p><p>6. Listen together and Notice Patterns: Listening effectively is arguably the most important aspect of a World Café.  The idea is that an effective listener can easily build off of what is being shared.  Because people tend to plan what they are going to say next instead of listening intently to everything this should be pointed out so participants can focus on listening intently.  Also, effective listeners should: listen to every person as though that person is truly wise, listen with an open mind, listen to deeper questions and insights, and “listen” for nonverbal cues.  
Share Collective Discoveries: In order to connect the whole group toward the end of the discussion, each table should summarize the key ideas, insights, themes, and deeper questions discovered through the discussion to share with the larger group.   To ensure that each table can effectively share their ideas with the entire group, there should be flip-charts of butcher paper sp tables can display their ideas to the group.  After each table has had an opportunity to share, the entire group should reflect on the groups larger findings with questions such as the following: what deeper questions have emerged here? Are there any patterns; if so what do they suggest? What has come to light because of these discussions? If there was a single voice here what would it say?<a href=""#cite_note-3"" title="""">[4]</a>
</p>
<a name=""History"" id=""History""></a><h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1995 the Intellectual Capitol Pioneers, a global, interdisciplinary group, hosted a two-day dialogue that resulted in deep, innovative, effective conversation.   Impressed with their experience, the hosts did further research and experimentation and voila, birthed the World Café design principals and its core concepts.  
</p><p>In the fifteen years since its commencement hundreds of groups, small and large, have used the World Café method to generate productive conversation.  One major milestone for the World Café was in August of 2007, when more than eighty hosts and participants from sixteen countries attended the World Café Stewardship Dialogue to explore World Café opportunities, what the World Café needs in order to thrive for years to come, and to share responsibility for those next steps. 
</p>
<a name=""Case_Studies"" id=""Case_Studies""></a><h2>Case Studies</h2>
<p>There are many success stories involving World Cafes, here is just one example:
The Financial Planning Association in Australia <a href=""#cite_note-4"" title="""">[5]</a> has so far hosted fifteen World Cafes to guide the growth of their new organization which is a result of a merger in January 2000 between two organizations.  The merger presented the opportunity to design a new organization, structurally and philosophically.  The cafes, which have ranged in size anywhere from 250 to 4000 people, have been successful at supporting this cultural shift as well as generating goals and steps toward making the new organization a success. 
</p><p>World Café meetings have also been used<a href=""#cite_note-5"" title="""">[6]</a>: in California among mediators of the judicial system; in Australia among government representatives, citizens, and business leaders; as a class reunion for the first graduation class in the Masters of Arts Leadership and Training from royal Roads University; to discuss cultural activity budget for a town meeting near Oslo; and by Wells Fargo bank to discuss a new technology plan for one bank division.  There are a plethora of World Café examples and success stories!
</p>
<a name=""Evaluation"" id=""Evaluation""></a><h2>Evaluation</h2>
<p>A World Café meeting is what the host(s) makes it.  There are plenty of success stories of organizations using the World Café to better their community, policies, technology, environment – whatever needs work.  The success of a World Café comes from having clear, meaningful questions to explore and making sure that meetings are set up to facilitate optimum participation.  The design principals outline the most important steps toward a productive World Café.  There are multiple resources for hosts, participants, and even the general public to learn more about the World Café methodology.

"<p><a id=""Definition"" name=""Definition""></a></p><h1>Definition</h1><p>The National Issues Forum (NIF) is a nationwide network of locally created public forums oriented towards the deliberation of public and political issues. It is a non-partisan network of smaller forums created nationwide whose goal is to gather people to reason with each other, deliberate and make public decisions together. Participants gather to discuss political issues and matters of public importance. They converse, deliberate, generate solutions to issues, and work together to select the best solution to the problem. NIF supports a healthy democracy by means of encouraging deliberation and interaction between individuals. Forums take place throughout the year and are sponsored by individuals, groups, or organizations which gather together participants. They deliberate on issues big and small such as health care, crime, and obesity. The size of meetings range from smaller in-home meetings to larger town hall meeting style forums. Anyone is able to participate in a forum by finding local meetings scheduled to take place using the calendar provided on the National Issues Forum website. The calendar lists dates, times, contacts, and issues that will be discussed. One may also plan a forum in their own community by contacting a trained moderator to facilitate the meeting. <a class=""external autonumber"" href=""http://nifi.org/forums/about.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""http://nifi.org/forums/about.aspx"">[1]</a></p><p><a id=""History"" name=""History""></a></p><h1>History</h1><p>The National Issues Forum started nearly thirty years ago in the summer of 1981. A group of twenty- five leaders held meetings and discussions, back when it was known as the Domestic Policy Association. The group originated after two years of discussions at the Wingspread Conference Center in Wisconsin. Their primary goal was to create a method to encourage citizens to have more involvement and engage in the public policy process. The main agenda was to hold annual dialogues involving domestic policy issues and provide an opportunity for a variety of views and solutions to be openly discussed. For their second meeting, they gathered community based leaders to create a new program which was different and separate from anything that existed at the time. At the third meeting, they developed a list of topics that “had a daily impact on a broad spectrum of the population, would engage public attention and discussion without overwhelming negative emotionalism, and involved both value judgments and technical considerations” (NIF website). They later changed their name from Domestic Policy Association to the National Forum’s Institute in 1989. Each year the National Forum contributes by selecting three topics for the deliberations that occur within the National Issues Forum. The three issues selected for the inaugural year of the National Issues Forum were: retirement and social security, inflation, and job and productivity (NIF). Currently the National Issues Forum facilitates and contributes to deliberation by establishing topics of relevance and public interest on a regular basis. <a class=""external autonumber"" href=""http://nifi.org/about/history.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""http://nifi.org/about/history.aspx"">[2]</a></p><p><a id=""Process"" name=""Process""></a></p><h1>Process</h1><p>The purpose of organizing a forum is to gather participants to discuss issues and deliberate on the best possible solution out of the initial choices given to them. During a forum, a problem is presented by the moderator along with three to four approaches to solving it. These forums provide a highway for ideas, shared experiences, and arguments to flow with the goal of selecting the best approach to the problem.. Each solution is discussed by the group with the guidance of a trained and neutral moderator. The participants are encouraged to read the provided pamphlet or issue book in order to foster a highly deliberative dialogue. Each approach is considered, examining its pros, cons, and trade offs. The responsibility of the moderator is to ask questions to initiate discussion, answer any questions the participants may have, remain neutral, and direct the group discussion in order to maintain a free flow of ideas. The moderator provides the participants an opportunity to express their thoughts and feelings on each of the possible approaches to the issue. a healthy democratic process, all participants have an equal opportunity of being heard. The group initially talks about the benefits of one approach, followed by its disadvantages, and upon completion of discussion, the group moves on to the next approach. Towards the end, the moderator puts each of the proposed solutions to vote. The participants work through the issue by finding common ground and formulating a thoroughly deliberated and well reasoned public judgment. <a class=""external autonumber"" href=""http://nifi.org/forums/participate.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""http://nifi.org/forums/participate.aspx"">[3]</a> <a class=""external autonumber"" href=""http://nifi.org/forums/organize.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""http://nifi.org/forums/organize.aspx"">[4]</a></p><p><a id=""Problems_.26_Purpose"" name=""Problems_.26_Purpose""></a></p><h1>Problems & Purpose</h1><p>The greatest issue fueling the creation of the National Issues Forum was a lack of civic education. Although people are surrounded by access to information regarding political conversations, very few seek it out to educate themselves. Most often, civic engagement comes in lieu of a subject that an individual is highly passionate about but involvement is often fleeting. Proposals to change the lack of civic involvement range from incorporating deliberative conversations in elementary and secondary school classrooms to promoting early engagement all the way to encouraging more participation of adults in National Issue Forums. The problems ultimately stem from a lack of education and create a lack of interest in issues not pertaining to a person's immediate life. The National Issues Forum relies on individuals and groups who wish to participate, but sadly due to a low level of education and interest, it brings less participants. Although the NIF is not struggling to find participants, more involvement means greater individual interest in politics and democracy. This chain of events is important in fostering political knowledge throughout the nation. The problem is how to reach groups that are vital to the deliberative quality of issue forums. The key to good deliberation and a successful forum is to involve many diverse individuals, experiences, and ideas. Often times the minority opinions are overlooked, but the incorporation of different perspectives is one of the main goals of the National Issues Forum. The purpose of the National Issues Forum is to provide an outlet for the public to discuss pertinent social and political issues. The end result is to reach a conclusion that allows people of diverse and varied views to arrive at a common ground. The result of the common agreement is to help participants and the public move towards collective action regarding a particular issue. An important point is that participants are encouraged to seriously analyze issues that deeply concern them, and also to educate the public on ways to promote deliberation. The National Issues Forum is also providing school teachers with options to promote deliberation in their classrooms. The website provides material and ideas to help foster early practice of reasonable and respectful discussion in younger individuals. Overall more instruction for young school children can be a positive foundation for greater understanding and participation in deliberative forums in the future.</p><p><a id=""Deliberation_and_Discussion"" name=""Deliberation_and_Discussion""></a></p><h1>Deliberation and Discussion</h1><p>Issues available for discussion are listed on the National Issues Forum webpage and predetermined for the year. In order to educate the public who are interested in participation, issue pamphlets are devised to summarize nonbiased facts and information regarding the topics. The issue pamphlets provides an overview of the issue along with the few suggested approaches to solving it. Participants are highly encouraged to make themselves familiar with the applicable pamphlet in order to foster the highest possible deliberative discussion. The trained and neutral moderators provided at each meeting help foster deliberation by leading the group conversation. They guide the participants to a discussion of the three to four broad options provided for approaching the issue. With these in place, the moderator’s goal is to then ask questions and steer the group so as to ensure a highly deliberative process, a smooth conversation, and a through coverage of the given approaches. As each possible solution is introduced, the participants engage in deliberation by brainstorming, analyzing, and considering the benefits and disadvantages of each solution. During the process, discussions may cause participants to become unsure of which position to choose, change their original stance, or be more attached to their original position. The participants are also able to educate not just themselves, but others as well by means of exchanging information, sharing values and experiences, and influencing others by means of convincing points and arguments. In the end, people with varying viewpoints arrive at a joint solution by finding common ground and making a decision for the public good.</p><p><a id=""Case_Example_1"" name=""Case_Example_1""></a></p><h1>Case Example 1</h1><p>Slavery or Freedom Forever? <a class=""external autonumber"" href=""http://nifi.org/stream_document.aspx?rID=18434&catID=18&itemID=18432&typeID=8"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""http://nifi.org/stream_document.aspx?rID=18434&catID=18&itemID=18432&typeID=8"">[5]</a> <a class=""external autonumber"" href=""http://www.nifi.org/stream_document.aspx?rID=16720&catID=16697&itemID=16719&typeID=8"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""http://www.nifi.org/stream_document.aspx?rID=16720&catID=16697&itemID=16719&typeID=8"">[6]</a></p><p>A recent forum was held on June 18, 2010 in Athens, Georgia. A small group of people and participants from the University of Georgia gathered to deliberate on questions of historical slavery and how past and present values continue to shape the history of slavery. The group used an issue guide that raised the three approaches people from 1854 dealt with contending with the issue of slavery and its future in this country. The three approaches were:</p><p>1. Remembering our ideals, judging slavery from a moral standpoint, and working towards ending slavery,</p><p>2. Treating slavery as a political problem to solve and affirming individual choice by giving local settlers the right to decide the national status of slavery,</p><p>3. Protecting the prosperity of the country by making decisions on slavery based on the economic well-being of the society.</p><p>The first approach led the group to discuss deeply held beliefs and values. They focused on the religious bases that people from 1854 adopted for this approach. The second approach led to a discussion about a divisive country having free and slave states. People recognized that taking a political approach to slavery makes it so the issue is inherent to self-interest and corruption. The third approach led to the discussion of economic growth as a result of slavery versus moral interests. Upon reflection, many thought that the first approach appealed to them best, reasoning that moral judgments are important in the decision making process. They rejected political and economic progress if it meant compromising their beliefs and values.</p><p><a id=""Case_Example_2"" name=""Case_Example_2""></a></p><h1>Case Example 2</h1><p>Weighing the Options: How can we encourage healthy weights among America’s youth? <a class=""external autonumber"" href=""http://www.nifi.org/stream_document.aspx?rID=17724&catID=6&itemID=17723&typeID=8"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""http://www.nifi.org/stream_document.aspx?rID=17724&catID=6&itemID=17723&typeID=8"">[7]</a></p><p>Obesity is becoming a larger problem every year as the number of children who are overweight has become greater over time. Children who experience problems with their weight often have long term health and emotional problems that ultimately cause greater public issues and costs. Every year obesity causes over 75 billion dollars of medical expense in the US alone. The purpose of the forum is to ultimately work together to better understand the problem and its consequences. It considers the benefits and drawbacks of different approaches to the problem; identify actions likely to make a positive difference and are doable in terms of time, resources, and public will. The participants examine the roles of government, schools, businesses, and civic and religious groups, as well as our responsibility as individuals; and explore potential next steps.</p><p>The three approaches for this forum are: 1. Expect personal responsibility for fitness 2. Invest in overall child well-being 3. Change our culture to encourage fitness</p><p>The first approach focuses on the problem being that children do not have enough education or supervision to understand what it means to be healthy. The second approach focuses on the concern of a child’s weight being the primary concern, rather than being concerned with other issues of the child’s well being. Lastly, the third approach focuses on changing the way we live our everyday lives with the help of advertisers by promoting healthier options. Each of the approaches have an emphasis on different concerns or solutions that may help this issue. The participants discuss and deliberate a variety of opinions and elaborate on pros and cons for each approach. They do all of these steps while maintaining the goal of keeping an open mind to all options before coming to an individual conclusion. After each approach is given ample time for discussion and exchange of viewpoints a final decision is made.</p><p><a id=""Evaluation"" name=""Evaluation""></a></p><h1>Evaluation</h1><p>With the right structure, facilitator, and participants the NIF is a very successful method for deliberation and discussion on important public policy issues. It is an organized way to not only hear other viewpoints and solutions, but also a platform to express personal views . The main point of the process is to keep an open perspective and opinion until all of the seen solutions and choices have been thoroughly discussed and understood. It is a step by step process that still has a very natural flow.</p><p>Although this is a great method for deliberative discussions on pressing issues, the results rarely bring an immediate change. The main point, however, is to educate and involve the public in order to make decisions on issues that affect the public. When discussing global and national issues in a small town setting it does limit the leverage and opportunity for change. However, its theory of change appears to be that it is changing systems and thinking on a small scale which over time will ultimately affect decisions made on a larger scale as smaller towns shift their focus and tactics. The NIF is a great opportunity for everyday citizens to get involved and participate in deliberative methods, but they also run the risk of limiting solutions and discussions if the group is not diverse enough to bring a variety of opinions and experiences. Commonly, people associate with and exchange information with people who have shared views, which can pose a problem if people are trying to develop unbiased solutions for the public rather than a segment of the population.</p><p>The following are possible impacts of NIF on participants, (Melville, Willingham, Dedrick, 2005) <a class=""external autonumber"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Issues_Forums"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Issues_Forums"">[8]</a></p><p>1. Participation in NIF forums heightens interest in specific issues and in public affair and leads to higher levels of public engagement.</p><p>2. Participation in NIF forums broadens the outlook of participants.</p><p>3. As a result of participating in forums, individuals come to experience themselves in different ways, and they learn new ways of taking part in groups.</p><p>4. Participation in NIF forums enhances people’s sense of themselves as political actors who can make a difference in their communities.</p><p>5. People construe their self-interest more broadly as a result of taking part in deliberative conversations.</p><p>6.

"<a name=""Definition"" id=""Definition""></a><h2> Definition </h2>
<p>Parliamentary procedure is the set of rules and bylaws adopted by various groups, ranging from the United States House of Representatives to high school Model United Nations clubs. Though its forms differ greatly between locations where it is implemented, the end goals of parliamentary procedure are the same, including equal opportunity for all members and to maintain orderly, accepted procedure. Parliamentary procedure attempts to ensure civil deliberation among members of an entity by guaranteeing equal rights and opportunities to those involved. Another key feature of parliamentary procedure, as described in Mason’s Manual, a handbook for one version of parliamentary procedure commonly seen in the United States, is that any entity that uses parliamentary procedure allow its members the chance to debate the question at hand, and that any debate be resolved by democratic voting. <a href=""#cite_note-0"" title="""">[1]</a>
</p>
<a name=""Forms"" id=""Forms""></a><h2> Forms </h2>
<p>Two of the main forms of parliamentary procedure are based on books – the one most commonly seen in the United States is based on Mason’s Manual, which focuses on ensuring democratic voting, as well as equal access and privileges to all those involved. Mason’s Manual was written specifically to help legislative bodies run more smoothly, with its egalitarian, democratic framework for parliamentary procedure. <a href=""#cite_note-1"" title="""">[2]</a> Robert’s Rules of Order was the first set of published rules of parliamentary procedure published in book form. It was published in 1876 and laid the groundwork for what has since become modern parliamentary procedure. Robert’s Rules of Order, unlike Mason’s Manual, was not intended for governmental use, rather for other societal entities and groups. Both forms strive to protect all voices in the group, even those which have little to no support. Robert's Rules of Order and Mason's Manual are both highly complex systems, with Mason's Manual being the more stringent as it was designed for matters of legislative significance. Mason's Manual has specific provisions in it which relate directly to certain governmental offices, so as to avoid any possible confusion on the floor. <a href=""#cite_note-2"" title="""">[3]</a>
</p>
<a name=""Participant_Selection"" id=""Participant_Selection""></a><h2> Participant Selection </h2>
<p>Participant selection is normally done through election or nomination, as is the case with parliamentary governments, but this holds true even in the case of high school clubs. Normally those already familiar with parliamentary procedure are selected, which makes the transition into their new role more fluid for the whole group.
</p>
<a name=""Process"" id=""Process""></a><h2> Process </h2>
<p>Parliamentary procedure is generally communally agreed upon by the members of a deliberative entity, and is thus established and enacted as the rules governing that group's deliberative procedure. Various groups approach this in different ways, hence the vast array of different forms of deliberation out there that fall under ""parliamentary procedure."" Most forms require a facilitator of some sort, such as a debate moderator, to ensure the maintenance of order and procedure within the group. The facilitator serves to rein in the discussion if it gets out of hand, maintain orderly voting, and sometimes determine the order of speakers if there is confusion.
</p><p>Parliamentary procedure also requires that there be sufficient advance notice of a meeting given to all members in order for it to be considered legitimate. This prevents the majority group from having a meeting without the presence of minority voices. <a href=""#cite_note-3"" title="""">[4]</a>
</p>
<a name=""Quorum"" id=""Quorum""></a><h3> Quorum </h3>
<p>Parliamentary procedure is most often used by governing entities, and elected representatives are generally the ones who partake in such deliberation. In order for a hearing to be held, there must be a quorum, or sufficient numbers in attendance. If quorum is not met, the hearing is adjourned. In the United States, quorum is a simple majority of those expected to be in attendance. A simple majority of votes is the requirement to make a decision, though in some places these numbers are changed based on circumstances.
</p>
<a name=""Speaking"" id=""Speaking""></a><h3> Speaking </h3>
<p>One of the core values of parliamentary procedure is to ensure that everyone has an equal opportunity to speak, regardless of whether they are in the majority or minority. This was first developed in Robert’s Rules of Order, for the sake of both guaranteeing the rights of the majority and protecting the rights of the minority. <a href=""#cite_note-4"" title="""">[5]</a> All forms of parliamentary procedure strive to ensure equality among all participants, regardless of majority or minority status. Speakers take turns giving speeches and addressing questions from other participants.
</p>
<a name=""Motions"" id=""Motions""></a><h3> Motions </h3>
<p>A motion is an action suggested by a member of the body. In order for a motion to be considered, it must be seconded by another member. At this point, the body must vote whether to approve the motion or reject it. Normally motions relate to postponing the legislation or calling the body to vote. Motions among motions are the motion to table, which means to set aside the topic at hand and move to another topic, a motion to commit, which means to refer a motion to a smaller committee it would be fitting for, a motion to previous question, which calls for an immediate vote and an end to deliberation, and a motion of no confidence, used to express dissent toward or a lack of faith in those in power. Any member can propose a motion at any time. <a href=""#cite_note-5"" title="""">[6]</a>
</p>
<a name=""Voting"" id=""Voting""></a><h3> Voting </h3>
<p>After everyone who wanted to speak has gotten the chance to, there is normally a motion to vote. Voting can be spoken (yea or nay) en masse, written in ballot form, conducted by counting raised hands, or each member of the body will be individually asked his or her vote, depending on the group and its bylaws. Votes are then tallied if needed, and the winner is announced after all votes have been counted. Each individual’s vote is equal, as the system is democratic. In some organizations, the facilitator, often a chairperson of some sort, is granted the power to break ties. <a href=""#cite_note-6"" title="""">[7]</a>
</p>
<a name=""Application_and_History"" id=""Application_and_History""></a><h2> Application and History </h2>
<p>Parliamentary procedure is used in numerous governments, including but not limited to the United States, the United Kingdom, Iceland, Australia, Finland, Russia, Spain, and Poland. <a href=""#cite_note-7"" title="""">[8]</a> In these cases (and many others), parliaments are used to deliberate on the merits of pieces of legislation, as well as discuss matters that may need to be made into legislation. 
</p><p>The history of parliamentary procedure as we know it dates back to the 18th century in the United Kingdom, though parliamentary procedure itself is said to date back to ancient Greece. The United Kingdom’s parliamentary laws crossed the sea when its citizens did, and thus were implemented in the government of the United States. Thomas Jefferson made some revisions to the British laws in what he called Jefferson’s Manual, a book on parliamentary procedure written specifically for the United States at the turn of the 19th century. <a href=""#cite_note-8"" title="""">[9]</a> In the late 19th century, Robert’s Rules of Order was written, and by the early 20th century, had become the definitive guide for parliamentary procedure. When Mason’s Manual was written in 1950, states began adopting it, seeing as it was specifically tailored to the needs of legislative bodies. Currently, different states use different versions of parliamentary procedure based on what has been adopted, though the majority use Mason’s Manual.

"<p><a id=""Definition"" name=""Definition""></a>Citizen Advisory Boards are a local government entity which consists of volunteer citizens from the community they represent. Citizen Advisory Boards add to the deliberative quality of a democracy by involving everyday citizens in political processes that help shape the policies of a local government.</p><h2>Definition</h2><p> The responsibilities of a Citizen Advisory Board include but are not limited to “the study of critical issues, taking public testimony, performing independent research, and reviewing staff reports and recommendations. These prepare the advisory body to discuss, analyze, formulate, and forward well-developed, thoughtful recommendations to the legislative body” (<a class=""external free"" href=""http://www.mrsc.org/Publications/lgcab08.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""http://www.mrsc.org/Publications/lgcab08.pdf"">http://www.mrsc.org/Publications/lgcab08.pdf</a>). While there are many different way to organize a Citizen Advisory Board, the majority are comprised of small groups of volunteers that are interested in getting involved in both local politics and the issues facing their community.</p><p><a id=""Process"" name=""Process""></a></p><h2>Process</h2><p>Citizen Advisory Boards are most frequently created by city governments, but there are instances where they are created at the state level in order to assist the state with issues that are best dealt with at a more local level. One of the key distinctions between boards is their decision making capacity. Some boards operate in a strictly advisory capacity while others hold administrative powers that allow them to make policy decisions. It is also important to keep in mind that cities and states are not limited to having just one Citizen Advisory Board. A city or state may have a number of Citizen Advisory boards in order to receive input on a number of different topics. “The method for creating them, by ordinance, resolution, or motion, tends to vary from one jurisdiction to another” (<a class=""external free"" href=""http://www.mrsc.org/Publications/lgcab08.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""http://www.mrsc.org/Publications/lgcab08.pdf"">http://www.mrsc.org/Publications/lgcab08.pdf</a>). In most cases, members of the board are appointed by the mayor. While there is no ideal number for a Citizen Advisory Board it is important that the group is large enough to have a broad range of ideas while remaining small enough that it is easy to manage.</p><p>After establishing the board, the responsibilities of the board must be clearly defined. Without clearly defined responsibilities the board is likely to lose focus on the assigned task and as a result will be less effective. Additionally, there must be support staff provided in order to assist with the administrative elements of the operation of the board. Once the responsibilities have been assigned, a support staff has been put in place and an orientation explaining the legalities involved has taken place the board can begin to operate.</p><p>Now that the board has been formed, procedural guidelines must be established. Some governments are less restrictive in terms of how their Citizen Advisory Boards operate and allow them to establish their own procedures as long as they are in accordance with the rules that have established the board in the first place. Other governments are stricter and require that their boards follow parliamentary procedure. Some feel that following parliamentary procedure rules enable the board to operate more efficiently while others feel that it creates a less comfortable environment which can stifle discussion. “Generally, boards will designate a chairperson to run meetings, set agendas, and provide general leadership. In some jurisdictions, advisory boards elect their own officers, but in others, the board chair or officers are appointed” (<a class=""external free"" href=""http://www.mrsc.org/Publications/lgcab08.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""http://www.mrsc.org/Publications/lgcab08.pdf"">http://www.mrsc.org/Publications/lgcab08.pdf</a>).</p><p>The final piece of the process is the Citizen Advisory Board reporting out to the governing body. This is essentially the final product that the board was created for in the first place.</p><p><a id=""History"" name=""History""></a></p><h2>History</h2><p>Due to the local nature of Citizen Advisory Boards it is difficult to pin down when the first of these boards occurred. At this time the earliest Citizen Advisory Board appears to be the 15-member Historical Affairs and Landmark Review Board in Arlington Virginia which was established in 1976. (<a class=""external free"" href=""http://www.co.arlington.va.us/departments/Commissions/HistoricalAffairs/CPHDOnsHpAffairsLandmark.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""http://www.co.arlington.va.us/departments/Commissions/HistoricalAffairs/CPHDOnsHpAffairsLandmark.aspx"">http://www.co.arlington.va.us/departments/Commissions/HistoricalAffairs/CPHDOnsHpAffairsLandmark.aspx</a>). Since then there have been thousands of Citizen Advisory Boards created across the United States from Kirkland, Washington to Dunedin, Florida.</p><p><a id=""Case_Studies"" name=""Case_Studies""></a></p><h2>Case Studies</h2><p>Case studies involving Citizen Advisory Boards have also taken place throughout the country. Here are a couple of the cities in which case studies have been performed:</p><p>Clearwater, Florida (<a class=""external free"" href=""http://www.naspaa.org/initiatives/paa/pdf/Karen_Sutton.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""http://www.naspaa.org/initiatives/paa/pdf/Karen_Sutton.pdf"">http://www.naspaa.org/initiatives/paa/pdf/Karen_Sutton.pdf</a>)</p><p>Fernald, Ohio (<a class=""external free"" href=""http://www.participedia.net/wiki/Fernald_Citizens_Advisory_Board"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""http://www.participedia.net/wiki/Fernald_Citizens_Advisory_Board"">http://www.participedia.net/wiki/Fernald_Citizens_Advisory_Board</a>)</p><p><a id=""Evaluation"" name=""Evaluation""></a></p><h2>Evaluation</h2><p>Citizen Advisory Boards have become a staple of our democracy nationwide. They increase the deliberativeness of our governments by engaging volunteer citizens and allowing them to be part of the political and governmental processes that occur in their local community. This serves to “overcome citizen apathy and disinterest by crafting lively and engaging participation programs” (<a class=""external free"" href=""http://www.naspaa.org/initiatives/paa/pdf/Karen_Sutton.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""http://www.naspaa.org/initiatives/paa/pdf/Karen_Sutton.pdf"">http://www.naspaa.org/initiatives/paa/pdf/Karen_Sutton.pdf</a>).</p><p>Such advisory boards serve a number of purposes including but limited to the following list provided by the Florida League of Cities (<a class=""external free"" href=""http://www.flcities.com/membership/library_coop_achievement.asp"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""http://www.flcities.com/membership/library_coop_achievement.asp"">http://www.flcities.com/membership/library_coop_achievement.asp</a>). The Florida League of Cities did not provide the additional text beyond the initial statement:</p><p>They allow for an in-depth examination of issues -</p><p>As Citizen Advisory Boards are often created to address a specific issue, they are able to perform a more in-depth analysis of the issue than the typical local government may be able to perform. As such, Citizen Advisory Boards are an excellent resource for local governments to use when tackling very specific local issues.</p><p>They serve as a communication channel between elected officials and the community -</p><p>By involving volunteer citizens in the process, Citizen Advisory Boards can act as a conduit to communicate the thoughts and ideas held by the community members to their local government officials.</p><p>They bring a broad range of ideas and expertise to public decision making -</p><p>Another strength of Citizen Advisory Boards is that due to their composition of people from the local community, they are often able to represent the diverse ideas and expertise that exist within the community. Doing so further enhances the deliberative nature of the local government.</p><p>They assist in resolving conflicts -</p><p>Citizen Advisory Boards are also uniquely equipped to be able to deal with conflict as they are able to utilize the aforementioned broad range of ideas and expertise to deliberate through such conflicts in order to reach a well-reasoned resolution.</p><p>They provide training for new leaders -</p><p>Citizen Advisory Boards are often used as a way for citizens to get their first experience in politics and government. This affords citizens the opportunity to experience political life without having to run for office.</p><p>Ultimately, if local governments are able to clearly communicate the purpose of a Citizen Advisory Board in addition to finding the right people and providing them with training, these boards can be a very valuable process in a deliberative democracy. Through the engagement of community members local governments are able to solve problems and give the people an opportunity to shape their city in the way they see fit.</p><p><a id=""References"" name=""References""></a></p><h2>References</h2><p><a class=""external free"" href=""http://www.co.arlington.va.us/departments/Commissions/HistoricalAffairs/CPHDOnsHpAffairsLandmark.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""http://www.co.arlington.va.us/departments/Commissions/HistoricalAffairs/CPHDOnsHpAffairsLandmark.aspx"">http://www.co.arlington.va.us/departments/Commissions/HistoricalAffairs/CPHDOnsHpAffairsLandmark.aspx</a> Arlington, Virginia Advisory Groups, Authorities, & Commissions</p><p><a class=""external free"" href=""http://www.participedia.net/wiki/Fernald_Citizens_Advisory_Board"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""http://www.participedia.net/wiki/Fernald_Citizens_Advisory_Board"">http://www.participedia.net/wiki/Fernald_Citizens_Advisory_Board</a> Fernald Citizens Advisory Board</p><p><a class=""external free"" href=""http://www.flcities.com/membership/library_coop_achievement.asp"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""http://www.flcities.com/membership/library_coop_achievement.asp"">http://www.flcities.com/membership/library_coop_achievement.asp</a> Florida League of Cities, Inc.</p><p><a class=""external free"" href=""http://www.naspaa.org/initiatives/paa/pdf/Karen_Sutton.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""http://www.naspaa.org/initiatives/paa/pdf/Karen_Sutton.pdf"">http://www.naspaa.org/initiatives/paa/pdf/Karen_Sutton.pdf</a> Local Citizen Participation: Case Study of a Community Development Board.</p><p><a class=""external free"" href=""http://www.mrsc.org/Publications/lgcab08.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""http://www.mrsc.org/Publications/lgcab08.pdf"">http://www.mrsc.org/Publications/lgcab08.pdf</a> Municipal Research and Service Center</p><p><a id=""Secondary_Literature"" name=""Secondary_Literature""></a></p><h2>Secondary Literature</h2><p><a class=""external free"" href=""http://consensus.fsu.edu/citizen_advisory_boards/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""http://consensus.fsu.edu/citizen_advisory_boards/index.html"">http://consensus.fsu.edu/citizen_advisory_boards/index.html</a> Successful Citizen Advisory Boards and Committees</p><p><a id=""Links"" name=""Links""></a></p><h2>Links</h2><ul><li><a class=""external text"" href=""http://www.aicab.org/"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""http://www.aicab.org/"">Anderson Island Citizens' Advisory Board</a></li><li><a class=""external text"" href=""http://www.nnmcab.org/"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""http://www.nnmcab.org/"">Northern New Mexico Citizens' Advisory Board</a></li><li><a class=""external text"" href=""http://www.pgdpcab.org/"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""http://www.pgdpcab.org/"">Paducah Citizens Advisory Board</a></li><li><a class=""external text"" href=""http://www.srs.gov/general/outreach/srs-cab/srs-cab.html/"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""http://www.srs.gov/general/outreach/srs-cab/srs-cab.html/"">Savannah River Site – Citizens Advisory Board</a></li></ul>",en,170,Citizen Advisory Board
"<p><a id=""Definition.2FProcess"" name=""Definition.2FProcess""></a></p><h2>Definition</h2><p>Everyday Democracy is an organization whose mission is “to help communities develop their own ability to solve problems by exploring ways for all kinds of people to think, talk and work together to create change.” Their goal is to address many different issues from racial inequality to growth and sprawl. One of the main projects they administer is the Communities Creating Racial Equity Initiative (CCRE) which was launched in 2007. The purpose of this project is to help communities create their own way of engaging in civic interaction and issues regarding racial equity, as well as learning how to address issues of racial equity. The CCRE has strengthened this project by developing a strong education base on racial equity and committing themselves to remove racial prejudice and oppression occurring in our communities. Everyday Democracy selects communities to participate in the CCRE project. Each community attempts to satisfy the vision of the CCRE through their own specific programs.</p><p><a id=""History"" name=""History""></a></p><h2>History</h2><p>The CCRE is a two-year initiative project that was launched in 2007 by Everyday Democracy. The program selected eight communities to take part in the this program in efforts to tackle civic engagement and community change on issues relating to racial equity. The nine communities chosen are Stratford, Conn.; Syracuse, N.Y.; Montgomery County Public Schools, Md; Hopkinsville KY; Lynchburg, VA; Jacksonville, FLA; Sacramento, CA; and New Haven, Conn. This two year initiative involved over 177 dialogues, engaging over 3,000 people. Over the two years, the project provided coaching, how-to materials, and two national learning meetings. These eight programs will work to in each community to reduce inequity among racial groups that exist in civic society and in systems such as education, health care, the justice system, jobs, immigration, and housing. This project is graciously funded by the C.S. Mott Foundation and the W.K. Kellogg Foundation. Their support allows Everyday Democracy to provide each city organization with technical assistance and fund teams to travel to learning conferences around the U.S. The Everyday Democracy has also provided small grants to the communities who apply. Action grants of $10,000 were provided to each site to implement and support actions that emerged through this dialogue process. Communities Creating Racial Equity has come at an important time in our country. There has been a lot of discussion of racism in civil engagement and this is partly because of the 2008 presidential election. An analysis on the “post racial America” has found that national discourse on racism is shifting and this analysis has helped our nation learn from the shift, and gives us the ability to shape it.</p><p><a id=""Participant_Selection"" name=""Participant_Selection""></a></p><h2>Participant Selection</h2><p>The communities were chosen by the strength of their proposals submitted. Everyday Democracy evaluates each proposal by looking at how the community wishes to address racial equity, their commitment to long-term change in their community, their strategies in bringing people of different ethnicities together to participate in conversations about racial and ethnic issues.</p><p><a id=""Deliberation_and_Public_Interaction"" name=""Deliberation_and_Public_Interaction""></a></p><h2>Deliberation and Public Interaction</h2><p>In every city chosen for the CCRE, different programs are used to support this CCRE focus.</p><p> </p><p>-Hopkinsville, Kentucky uses the Chamber of Commerce, led Hopkinsville Human Relations Commission to address racial diversity and poverty that is present in the community. This center hopes to educate the community and bring together individuals to invoke change in the community.</p><p>-Jacksonville, Florida has created a program called the Jacksonville Human Rights Commission whose goal is to bring about policy and institutional change. They want to induce change in many different areas such as business and economic development, education, housing, health, employment, justice, politics and media relations. Everyday Democracy sees this organization as a great foundation for promoting and executing the purpose of the CCRE project. The Jacksonville Human Rights Commission has been in work for 10 years and is still going strong.</p><p>-Lynchburg, Virginia is focusing on promoting open dialogue among the community in efforts to address the challenges with racism, and discuss ways to improve opportunities in the social, economic and educational areas of the city.</p><p>-Montgomery County Public Schools, Maryland has a 5 year old program called the Montgomery County Public Schools Study Circles Program whose goal is to eliminate ethnic and racial barriers in the education system. New Haven, Connecticut holds a Community Mediation that discusses immigration which is at the center of the racial and ethnic equity debate in New Haven.</p><p>- Sacramento, California fosters the Committee Addressing Racial Equity, and the Community Pride Project, through South Sacramento County Visions who work to build a relationship between businesses and residents. They hope to improve the life of south Sacramento’s diverse neighborhoods.</p><p>- Stratford, Connecticut has a program led through the mayor’s office which focuses on racial equity on education, and police-community relationships.</p><p>- Syracuse, New York has an 11 year old initiative led by the Community Wide Dialogue to End Racism program. They work to end racism and focus on the education, employment and neighborhoods which are affect by racism. Every city has a different way of going about their way of addressing racial equity in their communities. The CCRE’s goal is for the different communities to embrace the idea of community involvement and open discussion to deliberate and educate the community about racism. Each cities program has great promise, and with extra funding and support by the CCRE, their goals and mission will have a great chance of success.</p><p><a id=""Outcomes.2C_and_Effects"" name=""Outcomes.2C_and_Effects""></a></p><h2>Outcomes, and Effects</h2><p>The overall effects of these programs is greater education about racial equity and its affects on the community. Each city has its own personal outcomes and influence since every program is slightly different on how they approach and deliberate about racial equity. One example of a major outcome is in the Montgomery County Schools. The Montgomery school system found that their was a large gap between the level of education between hispanics and non-hispanics. They found the reason to be the lack of communication. As a result, Hispanic parents have been enlisted to help assist hispanic students with their studies. This has greatly improved the education level of hispanic children and the gap is getting more and more narrow. Another example of growing effects is through Jacksonville Human Rights Commission. Their study circles discuss racial issues in their community that anonymous people submit to the website. There is a section for ""complaints"" both in the community and employment. This allows for a basis of conversation for the study circles. Many of the other organizations are working towards creating positive outcomes for their community out of their deliberation process, and are close to doing so. Many of the programs have websites promoting their success and triumphs.</p><p><a id=""Analysis_and_Criticism"" name=""Analysis_and_Criticism""></a></p><h2>Reflections/Learnings</h2><p> </p><p><a id=""References"" name=""References""></a></p><h2>References</h2><p><a class=""external free"" href=""http://www.everyday-democracy.org/en/Article.694.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""http://www.everyday-democracy.org/en/Article.694.aspx"">http://www.everyday-democracy.org/en/Article.694.aspx</a></p><p><a class=""external free"" href=""http://www.everyday-democracy.org/en/SuccessStories.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""http://www.everyday-democracy.org/en/SuccessStories.aspx"">http://www.everyday-democracy.org/en/SuccessStories.aspx</a></p><p><a class=""external free"" href=""http://www.everyday-democracy.org/en/Issue.1.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""http://www.everyday-democracy.org/en/Issue.1.aspx"">http://www.everyday-democracy.org/en/Issue.1.aspx</a></p><p><a class=""external free"" href=""http://www.everyday-democracy.org/en/Page.Vision.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""http://www.everyday-democracy.org/en/Page.Vision.aspx"">http://www.everyday-democracy.org/en/Page.Vision.aspx</a></p><p><a class=""external free"" href=""http://kchr.ky.gov/localcomm.htm"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""http://kchr.ky.gov/localcomm.htm"">http://kchr.ky.gov/localcomm.htm</a></p><p><a id=""Secondary_Sources"" name=""Secondary_Sources""></a></p><h2>Secondary Sources</h2><p><a class=""external free"" href=""https://143.236.32.231/equity/Inclusive%20Excellence/Making%20Diversity%20Work%20on%20Campus.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""https://143.236.32.231/equity/Inclusive%20Excellence/Making%20Diversity%20Work%20on%20Campus.pdf"">https://143.236.32.231/equity/Inclusive%20Excellence/Making%20Diversity%20Work%20on%20Campus.pdf</a></p>",en,171,Communities Creating Racial Equity Initiative
"<a name=""Definition"" id=""Definition""></a><h2>Definition</h2>
<p>We the People is an elementary and secondary school oriented civic education process designed to enable students to learn about and address civic issues locally, regionally, and nationally.  It works to allow the student participants to educate themselves about a variety of governance-related topics and culminates in a series of simulated congressional hearings, with the most developed presenters proceeding to the state and national level competitions.  The primary focus of the program is the United States Constitution and the Bill of Rights, although the range from the abstract philosophical underpinnings of government to concrete proposals for government environmental policy.  The method repeats yearly and is designed to take a significant portion of a school year, and the entirety of one for the national competitors.
</p>
<a name=""Problems_and_Purpose"" id=""Problems_and_Purpose""></a><h2> Problems and Purpose </h2>
<p>We the People was created as a response to decades of decline in civic knowledge and participation which was conducted at the University of California, Los Angeles beginning in the 1960’s and included more than 250,000 matriculated college students from around the country. The study compiled evidence from 30 years of data showing that in 1998 “Only 26% of freshmen think that keeping up with politics is important, down from 58% in 1966. Only 14% say they frequently discuss politics, down from 30%”. (Galston 219). Subsequent studies also found that “35% of high school seniors were considered to have a ‘below-basic’ understanding of civic education or “near total civic ignorance” (Galston 221). Furthermore the study found that another 39% were only at the “basic” level, indicating a deeply systemic problem in civic participation and knowledge. 
</p><p>The Center for Civic Education makes the program’s goals explicit: “to promote civic competence and responsibility among the nation’s elementary and secondary students.”1  The intent is to expand knowledge about and encourage enlightened understanding of civic issues within the country, and by extension to increase public participation.
</p>
<a name=""History"" id=""History""></a><h2> History </h2>
<p>The organizing entity behind We the People is the Center for Civic Education, a civics organization created in 1964 as a committee at the University of California, Los Angeles.  In 1981 the organization transformed into a non-profit entity.  The We the People program was first implemented in 1987 by the Center for Civic Education and has continued yearly with funding from the United States Department of Education.2
</p>
<a name=""Participant_Selection"" id=""Participant_Selection""></a><h2> Participant Selection </h2>
<p>The program, by being academically grounded, is limited to students.  Within participating schools the method of participant selection varies.  It is at some a voluntary club activity, in others a optional substitution for a mandatory civics class, and at others is restricted to those who have taken a year-long prerequisite course.  Given that there is a minimum of three members in each unit at least 18 students are usually required, although some schools have students in multiple units, lowering the theoretical requirement to 3 total individuals.  There is no explicit upper bound on the number of participants from each school, although having seven of more members in each group will make it difficult to use the time available effectively.
</p>
<a name=""Program_Structure"" id=""Program_Structure""></a><h2> Program Structure </h2>
<p>The structure can be broken down into two parts which enhance the deliberative nature of the program; the Unit structure and the actual structure of the competition. 
</p><p>•	Units:
The Center for Civic education has broken down the competition into 6 units, comprised of 3 to 6 people. Each unit focuses on a relatively narrow range of topics, which allows them to unlock more meaningful aspects of the Constitution. In order to be successful participants must look past the obvious questions of the Constitution and into the deeper meaning and policy implications it has on the real world. Because participants work in groups of 4 or 5 and focus on specific portions of the Constitution they are able to discusses their chosen topics with greater insight; instilling a stronger sense of civic knowledge and duty. 
The Units topics break down accordingly (Civiced.org/wtpcompanion); 
</p><p>Unit 1) Historical and Philosophical Foundations of our County’s Ideas about Constitutional Government
</p><p>Unit 2) Creation of the Constitution
</p><p>Unit 3) Expansion of Rights since the Ratification of the Constitution in 1788
</p><p>Unit 4) Organization of the National Government
</p><p>Unit 5) Meanings of the Various Rights Guaranteed in the Bill of Rights
</p><p>Unit 6) Roles of Citizens in American Democracy
</p><p>Because the Units are discussing nebulous topics, there is a great deal of influence, discourse, compromise and persuasion which occurs through their discourse. This factor alone is a major contributor in strengthening the deliberative nature of this program. A study conducted by the Council for Basic Education in 1994 found that after competing in We the People; 
“exhibit more political tolerance in a number of ways, including (1) placing fewer restrictions on the press, speech and advocacy of radical or unorthodox ideas (2) more willingness to grant freedom of assembly to groups with diverse opinions (3) placing fewer restrictions on due process and (4) displaying a willingness to grant others a wide latitude of speech and act politically”         (Brody 6).
</p><p>The structure of these units adheres to the maxims of an ideal analytic process by encouraging students to engage in a back and forth dialogue in a manner which maintains a healthy team dynamic as outlined by communications professor Dr. John Gastil. The groups brainstorm a series of answers to the given questions and do so according to a strong information base in order to maximize the overall group success. The information is found by one group is almost always applicable to the research of other groups, encouraging cross-unit collaboration. Current events play a significant role in the formation of the group’s answers, so there is a constant need to remain updated on contemporary political and legislative changes. Personal experiences also play a key role in the group’s deliberation as they can incorporate those experiences into evidence to support their conclusion. Furthermore those conclusions must represent the comprehensive advocacies of all group members, as they will need to support them during the competition. 
</p><p>•	Competition:
After months of preparation, studying and discussion participants travel to a competition which includes students from other high schools around the State. The students are given 3 potential questions before the competition, which they have written speeches for, and are told which question they will be discussing when the judges enter the room. A panel of 3 judges questions the students, but in a manner which is to probe them to think deeper about their positions and defend them, which truly encourages the deliberative process. Because participants have no knowledge of the specific questions, or style of questions the judges will ask, they must think of their feet and be able to recall and apply relevant information quickly. The judges then score the responses based on the completeness of their answers, as well as the group’s support for their claims. Because the competition is essentially a conversation between the judges and participants, there is no fear of agreeing with the judges personal ideologies, but rather supporting the group’s personal advocacies.
The structure of these groups models the ideal social deliberative process , also outlined by Dr. Gastil which includes such maxims as distribution of speaking times, mutual comprehension and respect for all participants view points; as all of these are factors in the overall score the group will receive. 
</p>
<a name=""Examples"" id=""Examples""></a><h2> Examples </h2>
<p>The following are examples of the types of questions a Unit may receive, which represents the overall thesis of their argument, and the topic they would prepare research to support. 
Unit One: What Are the Philosophical and Historical Foundations of the American
Political System?
</p><p>1.	How did both classical republicans and the natural rights philosophers influence the Founders’ views about government? 
</p><p>•	What are the essential differences between classical republicanism and natural rights philosophy? 
</p><p>•	Why do both classical republicans and natural rights philosophers stress the need for education and preparation for citizenship?
</p><p>2. What are the fundamental characteristics of a constitutional government?
</p><p>•	In what ways does constitutional government mean limited government?
</p><p>•	Describe at least three provisions of the Constitution that provide a means of preventing the abuse or misuse of governmental power. Explain how these provisions work in our system of government today.
</p><p>3. What effect did colonial experiences have on the Founders’ views about rights and government?
</p><p>•	In what ways were eighteenth-century American and British societies similar or dissimilar in terms of the rights of individual liberty, equality of opportunity, and property?
</p><p>•	How did early state constitutions reflect colonial experiences as well as the ideas of classical republicanism and the natural rights philosophy?
</p><p>This type of questioning is essential in promoting the deliberative process because questions cannot be answered with black and white analysis. It incorporates a necessity to weigh the pros and cons of any given conclusion. The sub-questions create a broader range of analysis, forcing participants to ‘think outside the box’ and gain an understanding of that the judges will be looking for. 
</p><p>The competition represents an interesting hybrid between formal, mediated discussion and informal, casual conversation which maximizes the importance of participant knowledge and communication skills to promote a truly deliberative environment.

<p>What distinguishes We the People as a deliberative process rather than as a glorified class is the method of case development.  Each group is meant to specialize in a broad topic, such as US case law or the developmental process of the Constitution, and for each level of competition they are given three questions, with a number of subtopics, around which they need to develop a response.  The teacher, unlike in a normal class, is not the primary source of information beyond the initial several classes where general background knowledge is taught and units are usually selected.  After those classes the groups must work to create a timed written response to be presented at the simulated hearing, and more importantly to respond to follow-up questions that are not known prior.  The method for constructing the responses is determined by the participants, but must necessarily include a significant degree of consensus seeking to maintain a coherent group.  
</p><p>The hearings themselves are conducted by a variety of individuals, frequently including judges, politicians, and other legal professionals.  They will select one of the questions assigned to each group to be presented and will then ask impromptu follow-up questions.  This requires successful groups to be widely self-educated on each topic to deal with potentially obscure questions, as well as to have a significant depth of knowledge so that each question can be thoroughly responded to.  Neither the pre-assigned questions nor the hearing questions are intended to have correct responses, but rather to require the participants and groups to take and defend a stance.  They are thus not serving as what would be technical experts in a real hearing, but as the subjects of the hearing or as representatives for the subjects.
</p><p>In addition to interacting with public officials and legal professionals during the competitive stage, many teams use experts in constitutionally related issues as everyday class resources. For example, a team may invite a Constitutional lawyer into their classroom to collaborate with them on questions that require more research or discuss ways to increase civic engagement with experienced politicians across that region. During tournaments, teams frequently visit prominent public leaders as a way to both contact people in power about issues they are passionate about as well as to consult them about issues they have been researching. These methods and experiences give participants insight into the inner workings of government agencies and ability to contact political leaders in an effort to understand policy and actively engage with the government. This contact represents deliberation by actively sharing personal ideas and ideals as well as provides a mechanism for students to become more passionate about these issues and become increasingly motivated to be responsible civic participants.

<a name=""Outcomes.2C_and_Effects"" id=""Outcomes.2C_and_Effects""></a><h2> Outcomes, and Effects </h2>
<p>The main outcome from the We the People… program is increased civic engagement and virtue. Because one of the essential components involves being engaged in critical analysis of media and political actions, an active citizenry is inherent in the process of education that We the People fosters. In an exit study of student participants in the 2010 We the People competition, 63% of students reported that either they had or were planning on contacting an elected official whereas only 23% of non-We the People students reported that they were planning on contacting an elected official. (Eschrich, 3) Professor Richard Brody of Stanford University explains ”the We the People… program is effective in promoting political tolerance because students in the program become more interested in politics, feel more politically effective, and perceive fewer limits in their own political freedom.” (Council for Basic Education, 5) Comparatively, in other nations that experience a significant rift between civic culture and government politics form a “patron-client” atmosphere. (Rice, 100) In response to this, nations that experience the divide between the two sects of governance and wish to represent true democracy by creating civic programs similar to what the We the People program strives to achieve (Chareka and Sears).
</p><p>While legal adults may have few opportunities to engage with government and civic issues, pre-voting-age students have even fewer.  We the People, though limited in its direct influence on government, provides students with a rare opportunity to engage with and learn about issues and to interact with government officials and professionals in the mock hearings.  Through crafting their groups’ positions on the issues they must themselves develop their own political stances in collaboration with other students.  This has lead to We the People students being significantly more knowledgeable about government, rights, and law, and to be more civically active.3
</p><p>In addition to fostering more active citizenship in American Democracy, the openly deliberative structure of the We the People… classroom fosters a unique educational experience. A pilot test of the We the People… curriculum revealed “statistically significant differences between those students who used We the People and those students who used a different civics curriculum and between students enrolled in AP classes and students in regular classes…the hypothesis that participating in We the People significantly adds to student performance over and above the role of class placement is confirmed.” (Ardice Hartry, 11) This data implies an educational difference in civics based on the deliberative and collaborative process provided by the program.

</p>
<a name=""Analysis_and_Criticism"" id=""Analysis_and_Criticism""></a><h2> Analysis and Criticism </h2>
<p>The focus on ensuring enlightened understanding among the participants has both positive and negative impacts.  The process does result in greater civic awareness and action by participating students; however, it does not, despite frequent involvement by government officials, offer any direct participatory role by the students in the formation of policy.  To some extent this is understandable, given that most participants are not legal adults and are thus are traditionally excluded from public decision-making processes.  However, the extent of the knowledge gained over the course of the program is not trivial, leaving the participants uniquely qualified to address a number of complex issues.  The number of participants available might thus constitute an untapped pool for more direct civic engagement by the program, or by related efforts.
</p><p>Locating this program within the school system similarly provides both positive and negative impacts.  It sharply limits the accessibility of the program to the general public, but allows for a significantly greater commitment then most would be able to make outside of a class setting.  While this should be acknowledged, it does not appear to be a significant detriment considering the other programs managed by the Center for Civic Education and other groups in which adults can participate, and indeed are often the only allowed participants.
</p><p>The largest cause for concern within the We the People program is the lack of general accessibility and funding. The United States Department of Education contributes a limited number of free materials to each congressional district, which limits the number of schools that can participate and thus the overall national participation in the program (Eschrich). Limited accessibility of the We the People… program is troublesome for the deliberative goal of the program. Limited access to materials and funding has historically drawn affluent schools into the program and rejected schools that are not well funded or in poverty-stricken neighborhoods. This lack of representation limits the political perspectives that can be brought into the competition.
</p><p>Another criticism of the function that We the People… provides is of the competitive nature of the class and activity. The competition portion of the program can override the educational and deliberative aspect of creating educational materials. The incentive to win in competition can motivate students to tailor their responses in a way to create answers that they believe will convince the judges rather than reflect their own beliefs. This motivation also leads students to stray from the activity’s mission of applying personal experiences and unintentionally encourages overemphasis on scholarly sources that will create an aura of scholarship within a particular group’s answers. 
</p><p>Division of labor within groups can also provide a detrimental impact on the deliberation within We the People… by forcing each group to focus on one portion of the competition rather than engage in a holistic constitutional debate, each group is led to specialize in some aspect of the Constitution, while being educationally anemic on others. For example, a member of Unit 1 may be extremely proficient on philosophical underpinnings of the Constitution and authors such as John Locke or Jean-Jacque Rousseau but may have nominal background on judicial intervention during the civil rights movement.
</p><p>One important aspect of the We the People… lesson plan is an emphasis on group collaboration and self-direction. The hands-off approach that is asked for teachers to take while in this program creates an opportunity for conflict within groups. Personal attitudes as well as inappropriate skill-sets both contribute to the possibility that some students will not be effective in their use of the process of social deliberation. Teachers must also be constantly aware of the opportunity to neglect using in-class opportunities wisely. This detracts from deliberation within groups because the lack of properly moderating group interaction creates an opportunity for dominant voices to control group views and create a spiral of silence within individual groups.
</p>
<a name=""Future_of_the_Program"" id=""Future_of_the_Program""></a><h2> Future of the Program </h2>
<p>Funding has been a consistent problem of the We the People… program. Despite its success nationwide, there has never been a stable funding source other than Congressional appropriations and private donations. This mechanism is problematic because it does not ensure a consistent income throughout tough economic times, which places We the People… in jeopardy of discontinuation. This problem exacerbates the lack of accessibility as well as the lack of expansion efforts to more schools nationwide. Unless the program secures some sort of reliable funding source, the goals of civic engagement and responsibility will not be fully realized. In response, local school boards and commercial organizations individually have taken it upon themselves to contribute to students’ educations by funding trips to competitions as well as educational materials necessary for participation in the program. While the program boasts 28 million students since inception (Eschrich), individual school participation has not increased dramatically, largely due to funding limitations as well as a lack of knowledge of the program. Illustrating the significance of the program past college applications and transcript significance could increase the deliberative aspect of the program and students that would not have previously considered participating in the We the People… program.
</p>
<a name=""Supporters"" id=""Supporters""></a><h2> Supporters </h2>
<p>The We the People… program is mainly supported by the Center for Civic Education, American Heritage Foundation, Pew Charitable Trusts, as well as other public-policy oriented organizations. The primary goal for many of the contributors to this organization is to promote civic responsibility and education rather than promoting any particular partisan goals or ideology. The strong interest in this program represent the desire for greater civic education in general rather than the fulfillment of particular interests, highlighting a desire to promote civic participation over advocacies in self-interest. This display of altruism is unique to this particular portion of education because there is seemingly no long-term profit motive other than to improve and preserve the American political landscape for the future.

"<p> </p><p>Definition  </p><p>A Social Forum is a one to four day event that addresses a wide number of topics of concern to civil society organizations and individuals opposed to neoliberal economic globalization through workshops, demonstrations, panels and plenary discussions. The guiding Charter of Principles, established in 2001 at the first World Social Forum in Porto Alegre, Brazil, defines a Social Forum as:  </p><p>... An open meeting place for reflective thinking, democratic debate of ideas, formulation of proposals, free exchange of experiences and interlinking for effective action, by groups and movements of civil society that are opposed to neoliberalism and to domination of the world by capital and any form of imperialism, and are committed to building a planetary society directed towards fruitful relationships among Humankind and between it and the Earth.  (Article 1, WSF 2001)  </p><p>Although the Social Forum method began in Porto Alegre as the World Social Forum, it has now been diffused to local, national and regional Forum occurrences, each a repeated, networked and interconnected gathering of advocates for social change and justice that are seeking new communicative methods, collective action means, and engaged global politics (Smith et al, 2008). A uniting theme is to explore the impact at the local, regional and national level of the pervasive form of economic globalization ('neoliberalism') that emphasizes the interests of capital rather than human relationships in international economic decision-making. On grounds of social justice, Forum participants largely oppose the neoliberal free market principles of privatization, fiscal austerity, reduced trade barriers and cuts in basic subsidies promoted by global financial and political institutions to encourage capital expansion. The Social Forum process is an important tool to creating and deepening transnational dialogue between individuals, non-governmental organizations and social movement networks to identify shared problems and explore diverse possible types of alternative economic and political organization. Building alternatives at Social Forums must above all respect local autonomy and participation in international economic and political decision-making, especially given the profound effects of these decisions at all levels of society. The sharing of experiences of the impact of neoliberal globalization upon marginalized and disempowered groups is an important pedagogical goal of the Social Forums, ideally creating a broad and more inclusive analysis of the impact of economic globalization.  </p><p>Marlies Glasius further defines the notion of Social Forums as a meeting of 'civil society' to be a convergence of ""people organizing to influence their world,"" arguing that the new phenomenon of Social Forums holds significant potential for global democracy because it mines the creative tension between two different strains of thought about civil society: Habermas's conception of civil society as a locus of deliberation versus Gramsci's conception of civil society as a locus of struggle (Glasius, 2005). Indeed, the many contradictions and uncertainties internal to the Forum process are defined by a tension between those who what it to be a space of deliberation and those who want it to be a political actor or force for change in its own right. The slogan of the Social Forum, 'Another World is Possible,' is sought by global civil society actors by both by staging alternative debates and by proposing alternative policies to influence existing institutions, but also through the prefigurative creation of alternative participatory political organization through grassroots struggle. Taking as its guiding principle that democratic governance requires participation, the Social Forum seeks a new model of global governance and civil society.  </p><p>As the Social Forum process approaches its first decade in existence, it is arguably the characteristic form of grassroots civil society organizing of the first decade of this century. Social Forums are a more open, inclusive and participatory complement within global civil society to the large and highly institutionalized network of international NGOs. The popularity of the Social Forum is probably due to their low organizing costs and inherent flexibility and mobility, not to mention the ability of Social Forums to combine the advantages of face-to-face interactions in terms of community-building and leadership with the efficiency of web-based organizing in terms of information dissemination and management (ibid).  </p><p> </p><p>History  </p><p>The history of the Social Forum process shares much with the history the 'anti-globalization moment', or, renamed by subsequent World Social Forum discussions, the Global Justice and Solidarity Movement. The idea for the World Social Forum (WSF) as a worldwide civil society event was initially proposed by Oded Grajew, the coordinator of the Brazilian Business Association for Citizenship (CIVES), and Francisco Whitaker of the Brazilian Justice and Peace Commission (CBJP) to Bernard Cassen, President of the Association for the Taxation of Financial Transactions for the Aid of Citizens (ATTAC) and Director of the Le Monde Diplomatique, in February 2000. The Forum was planned to be held in the global South, particularly Porto Alegre, a city that could offer organizational resources through the ruling Worker's Party (PT) and political inspiration given its noted model of participatory budgets (Juris, 2005). The name 'World Social Forum' and the coincident dates of the event was chosen to evoke opposition to the annual World Economic Forum held in Davos, Switzerland [1]. Preceding mass mobilizations, including Seattle 1999, brought to the world stage the method of international protest as a new form of political participation in the global justice movement, of nonviolent disruption with a lack of formal leadership and the prominence of networked affinity groups. Although global protests are critical venues of learning, coalition-building, communication and action, they alone were seen as insufficient, since they articulate largely negative sentiment (Smith et al, 2008). What was needed was a venue appropriate to formulating and proposing concrete alternatives.  </p><p>Building from previous convergence processes, including Zapatista Encounters in Chiapas and Spain and United Nations (UN) civil society forums, the WSF was envisioned to fill this void. The Zapatista movement is often cited as a key source of inspiration. The rapid and plural extent of citizen mobilization against NAFTA and FTAA in the Amercias at the turn of the millennium played a deciding role in the convocation of the first WSF in Brazil in 2001, establishing the necessary ability to use the new medium of the Internet to disseminate information and organize collective action and a willingness to enlist the support and encourage the solidarity of diverse NGOs and social movement organizations. Dorval Brunelle has argued that the style of these new mobilizations assured that it would proliferate at all levels of social life, as the Social Forum process now does (Brunelle, 2009). Further, the WSF was intended to build upon the activist cooperation encouraged by UN global conferences [2], and compensate for a perceived lack of a substantial role for transnational (as well as regional, national and local) civil society organizations from NGOs within the UN system. Civil society disillusionment with the U.N. was deepened by the setbacks of the five-year review processes of the Summits held in 1997 and 2000 (Smith et al, 2008:14). There was little tangible progress on social issues because the structure of the U.N. privileges major countries who often refuse to address key issues. A lack of government follow-through lead to calls for an alternative venue for the emergent international cooperative realm of civil society. The WSF was conceived to be this alternative venue, and as such it is an explicit recognition of the limitations of the U.N. both externally and internally. Finally, the women's movement also lends historical precedent to the Social Forum process. The Forum has been interpreted as a concrete example of the dissemination of feminist organizing principles that promote non-hierarchical participatory processes, decentralized, respectful dialogue and cooperation. The WSF was modelled after an encuentro, the region-wide feminist meetings in South America that took place throughout the eighties and nineties as a meeting organized around a collectivity of interests without hierarchy (Alvarez et al, 2009).  </p><p>The Brazilian Organizing Committee (BOC) was formed with eight Brazilian organizations participating including the Brazilian Labor Federation (CUT), Landless Workers Movement (MST), and six smaller organizations [3]. The support of the Worker's Party municipal government of Porto Alegre and the state government of Rio Grande do Sul was secured in March 2001, gaining significant resources from these governments. The Charter of Principles was formulated by the Brazil Organizing Committee in April 2001, which was then modified and approved by the International Council (IC) in June 2001. The IC was created after the first WSF to oversee the global expansion of the process (Juris, 2008).  </p><p>More recently, the Social Forum process has undergone a geographic proliferation from centralized world meetings to local, regional and national settings, connected across diverse locales and scales of action through allegiance to the Charter of Principles. This new phenomenon has been described as ""political improvisation,"" evoking the fluid and organic nature of the Social Forum process itself (Smith et al,  2008:108). Its relatively malleable structure allows innovative response to the tensions inherent to realizing its goals, particularly the conflicts between interconnected yet diverse and unique local and global scales of political action These innovations attempt to simultaneously develop global transnational dialogue and expand both local and national organizing efforts. There is a need for Social Forums at all levels to help local communities relate their immediate interests and experiences to broader debates and analyses, building shared identities and understandings. In the Social Forum process, instead of being inherently oppositional, each of these levels is understood as in creative tension with one another, with each being informed by the other (Waterman, 2004). However, simultaneously widening global networks and empowering local communities with limited resources is a daunting task. The logistics of bringing diverse people to the central WSF cannot sideline local activism. The process has adapted to cope with this tension. For example, the 2006 'polycentric' WSF occurred simultaneously in 3 cities of the global South (Bamako, Mali, Caracas, Venezuela and Karachi, Pakistan). In 2008, the centralized world gathering in a specific place was suspended in favour of a global organization of thousands of local autonomous organizations, on or around January 26. This event was also known as the Global Call for Action. Finally, the tenth anniversary year of the WSF, 2010, will not have a single centralized event but rather is intended to happen in permanently all year long with events throughout the world.</p><p> </p><p>Problems and Purpose</p><p>As economic globalization deepens and expands, the space for democratic participation at the international level becomes even more limited. The Social Forum process is a democratizing force that models many important aspects of future citizen participation in global political and economic policy decisions. Activists take it upon themselves to direct their actions and strategies at global institutions in transnational space as opposed to only directing it at their own national states (della Porta, 2006). Civil society groups and individuals attempt to unite their demands for a more democratic global polity, promoting the view that we cannot govern well by markets alone, that democratic political institutions are necessary on all levels, and that governments must be both accountable and responsive to the social impact of their trade and economic policies, which should not be separated from or privileged above social policy goals. Social forums are formally autonomous from traditional government and international organizations like the U.N. in order to experiment with new forms of democracy on the global level [4]. In contrast to formal elections, the very process of the Social Forum is a response to the demand for more inclusive democratic decision-making on a necessarily global scale. Social Forums have emerged a viable networked public space that transcends traditional territorially-based institutions that are inextricably bound to the borders of traditional states. This new organizational structure seeks to provide citizens with a significant space to learn about and engage in debate about the existing organization of the international economic and political system. The educational aspect of the Social Forum space is essential: participants learn about global politics, how to relate local experiences with their global precedents and develop a global awareness, identity, knowledge and skills. Though it remains doubtful that the Social Forum will develop the internal will-formation mechanisms necessary to being a unified and active political entity in its own right (something of a unified or representative 'global civil society,' or 'movement of movements') it is clear that until now, the most important democratic impact of the Forum has been its ability to facilitate encounters between different groups and activists (Teivainen, 2004). This is consistent with the concurrent creation of new democratic political culture that emphasizes networking logic rather than command logic and horizontal 'open space' organization rather than traditional hierarchical or vertical structures (Brunelle, 2009). </p><p>Given its historical precedents in 'new' social movements, new information technology, the Zapatista solidarity activism and anti-free trade mobilization, the Social Forum process can be understood as exhibiting the same 'cultural logic of networking' that arguably creates the opportunity for more equitable participation (della Porta, 2007). As opposed to the 'command logic' of traditional parties and unions that require disciplined membership, unified strategy and institutionalized political representation to win their supposed struggle for hegemony, the Social Forum, much like the new social movements that helped create it, exhibits horizontal ties among diverse, autonomous elements including the free and open circulation of information, collaboration through decentralized coordination and consensus decision-making, and self-directed networking (Smith et al, 2008). Arturo Escobar refers to networked politics as a form of 'distributed intelligence,' malleable and innovative, explaining the adaptive nature of the Social Forum (2009) [5]. Rodrigo Nunes has argued that from this 'politics of networking' emerges new goals: openness and horizontality (Nunes, 2005). Indeed, these goals are embraced by the Social Forum process, built around the organizational concept of an 'open space' of encounters and exchange of resources, ideas and information that is seen to be essential to creating concrete alternatives through equitable participation methods. Unlike traditional parties and unions, the goal of the Social Forum is to encourage 'horizontal' grassroots participation among actors in contrast to 'vertical' integration where decisions are made according to existing hierarchy. Horizontal organization is decentralized, open and ideally non-hierarchical in the decision-making process in order to prefigure the type of society that is to be created. In contrast, traditional vertical organization is explicitly hierarchical, institutionalized, often professionalized and occurs within representative structures. Many professional non-governmental organizations (NGOs) exhibit these vertical structures, thus, organizations and networks that participate in official Social Forums can sometimes be vertical in their internal organizing structure.</p><p>Many radical networks are critical of the vertical structure of many prominent elements of the official Social Forum, including professional NGOs and the role of the Organizing and International Committees [6]. In response, the creation of autonomous spaces at the margins of the Forum has flourished. This space allows radicals to produce their own horizontal practices and yet remain connected to the mainstream, maintaining an informed yet critical stance and hold official spaces accountable to their expressed participatory ideals. Autonomous spaces change the organization of the Social Forum itself. Instead of a single, all-inclusive open space, the autonomous spaces create a multiplicity of networked spaces. This adaptation of the form of the Forum to the activity of participants inspired the move towards the polycentric WSF and the proliferation of local and regional Social Forums. The politics of autonomous space is a symptom of the broader networking logic employed by these groups, valuing connection that maintains diversity of identity and interest. In the autonomous spaces, radicals create a forum for self-managed political expression, agenda-development, actions and political discussion in an open and participatory way, though not necessarily without conflict, especially as many of these groups espouse confrontational direct action tactics. For example, Juris recounts his participation at the 2002 WSF with the direct action group Caracal Intergaláctika:</p><p>""Immediately following the tactics and strategy discussion, dozens of us took the bus from the youth camp to the university for a ‘guided tour’ of the VIP room. Soon after arriving, we joined the anarchist Samba band from Sao Paolo (dressed in black, rather than the usual pink we were accustomed to) and danced our way up to the second floor. We continued to march through crowds of surprised, yet delighted onlookers. When we burst into the VIP room, a heavy-set Brazilian with long Rastas jumped onto the counter, tossed plastic bottles of water to the crowd, and led us in an enthusiastic chant, “We are all VIPs! We are all VIPs!” We then gave ourselves, and a group of nervously amused NGO delegates, an impromptu bath. The Forum organizers were livid, and only the intervention of our well-connected allies spared us from a direct confrontation with the police. However, as a Brazilian OC member confided to us at the IC meeting in Barcelona later that spring, there would be no VIP room the following year."" (Juris, 2008:262)</p><p> </p><p>Participant Selection</p><p>The Forum may strive to be an open space, but it is by no means a neutral space, given that self-selected participants must adhere to a charter that rejects neoliberalism and the militarization of globalization. The requirement to reject neoliberalism formally excludes not only those who already disagree with Social Forum participants, but also seems to encompass those who have not yet decided or remain uninformed of the pros and cons of neoliberalism. It remains a point of contention that, if the Forum is indeed restricted to only those with a defined negative position on neoliberalism, the it can hardly be considered 'open' [7]. Another contentious issue is the exclusion of government representatives like political parties. According to the Charter of Principles, Social Forums must cultivate ""a plural, diversified, non-confessional, non-governmental and non-party context."" This was intended to keep the Forum a purely civil society endeavor, without opening it to being exploited by politicians for electoral gain. However, this exclusion has been enforced inconsistently and excluding parties altogether may be in fact detrimental to achieving Forum goals [8].The controversies surrounding who may and should participate in the Forum process continue to generate debate as the Forum seeks to avoid becoming either an inward-looking space for like-minded civil society organizations or a political tool of traditional electoral politics (Teivainen, 2004).  </p><p>Putting aside questions of who should participate, who does participate in the Social Forum process is also significant, since the process aims to expand participation in global politics and reduce the exclusions constructed by existing political and economic structures. These structural challenges can be daunting, especially in the case of the centralized World Social Forum. Geographic inequalities often limit the representation of global diversity at the Forum, especially given the necessity of access to time and travel resources and the varying degrees of connectivity to transnational civil society organizations. Those who would most benefit from economic and political change are often unable to attend, like women from Africa and Asia. Since there is a consistent over-representation of those who live in proximity to sites, all World Social Forums are held in the global south to facilitate participation of marginalized groups. Regional forums are also organized to be held in areas perceived to be negatively affected by economic forces or perceived in the cultural milieu (i.e. the choice of Detroit, Michigan for the 2010 USSF). </p><p> </p><p>In 2005, the University of California at Riverside distributed 639 surveys to participants in 3 languages in diverse locations at the WSF in Porto Alegre. The UC Riverside survey provides an interesting snapshot of the characteristics and participation patterns of the participants. The survey found that the majority is politically active in alternative types of participation. 85% have protested at least once in the past year while 31% have protested 5 or more times. There is a balanced representation of gender but more men travelled from elsewhere to attend the Forum. Also, African and Asian women are underrepresented, and men are speakers more often (Karides, 2007). Youth has a significant presence; 42% of participants are under 26 years old. The unconventional format of the WSF and its allegiance with protest groups and new social movements helps to explain its appeal for younger people, who may have replaced the traditional duty paradigm of citizenship with a more engaged paradigm of citizenship (Dalton, 2008). The majority are well-educated, with 61% that have 16 or more years of formal education. The majority 70% are students or middle-class intellectuals or professionals (1/3 students; 15% professors or teachers) that hold a college or university degree or associate with an academic institution. In contrast, 10% are working class, 6.7% hold service jobs and only 3.1% are unemployed, which is unexpectedly low given the high rate of unemployment in the area at the time. However, the over-representation of those with middle-class backgrounds and students reflect widespread inequalities in political participation. Even in voting and conventional politics, the working class does not participate as often. Participation by grassroots activists, community organisers and disadvantaged individuals is largely geographically determined (i.e. when in Porto Alegre, 79% are from South America, 54% of those from Brazil). Asia and Africa were seriously underrepresented; although they comprise 32% of the global population, they accounted for only 7.7% of the respondents to the survey. This demographic no doubt influenced the selection of Nairobi, Kenya as the 2007 WSF site (Smith et al, 2008). </p><p>   </p><p>Deliberations and Decisions</p><p>The Social Forum process values diversity, and no unified voice may legitimately claim to represent either the Forum or its participants. The Charter of Principles states that:  </p><p>The meetings of the World Social Forum do not deliberate on behalf of the World Social Forum as a body. No one, therefore, will be authorized, on behalf of any of the editions of the Forum, to express positions claiming to be those of all its participants. The participants in the Forum shall not be called on to take decisions as a body, whether by vote or acclamation, on declarations or proposals for action that would commit all, or the majority, of them and that propose to be taken as establishing positions of the Forum as a body. It thus does not constitute a locus of power to be disputed by the participants in its meetings, nor does it intend to constitute the only option for interrelation and action by the organizations and movements that participate in it. (Article 6, WSF 2001)</p><p>The often-cited metaphor of the Forum as 'open space' arguably captures the intent of this section of the Charter. The Social Forum process was initially created to be the infrastructure for groups, movements and networks to share and build proposals and action platforms rather than as an actor in its own right with a unified program and strategy. If the 'open space' of the WSF is to be interpreted as a deliberative or discursive public space, then this deliberation cannot be understood as taking place on behalf of the Social Forum as a body. Rather, its purpose remains limited to internal contestation. Drawing from Habermas, early WSF organizers like Chico Whitaker envision the Social Forum as a convergence of civil society organizations in the public sphere that is divorced from the system of the markets and the state to allow influential opinion to develop through democratic procedures (Habermas, 1996; Whitaker, 2003). If the Social Forum were to become a locus of power, this would impose necessary administrative and bureaucratic efficiency mechanisms on the process that would negate its essential purpose as an inclusive democratic and deliberative space (Whitaker, 2003). However, there is no consensus regarding the appropriate role of the Forum, whether as discursive space or political actor, and the exclusive dichotomy between the two roles has been questioned, particularly by the Porto Alegre Consensus and the Bamako Appeal. The Porto Alegre Consensus, also known as the 'G19 declaration' [9] is a series of action strategies proposed by nineteen prominent intellectuals on June 29, 2005 at the fifth WSF. The Bamako Appeal appeared during the polycentric 2006 WSF. Like the Porto Alegre Consensus, the Bamako Appeal was drafted in closed, though somewhat larger, circumstances, including eighty prominent figures rather than nineteen. The Porto Alegre Consensus was immediately criticized as a violation of the Charter because it seeks to form a sufficient Forum consensus to act on the developed collective consciousness and thus implicitly seeks to unify or represent the Forum as a movement or body in itself rather than as a space. The Bamako Appeal was received with greater consideration, although the circumstances of its creation were still considered suspect [10].</p><p>Further, it should be noted that the Forum is not limited to rational discourse but is also an outlet for embodied performance and spectacle that is visually and emotionally compelling. These performances are equally valued in the Forum process as legitimate narrative devices that are unique ways of giving voice to experiences of marginalization that could not be expressed using rational discourse alone. For example, the 2004 WSF in Mumbai was attended by approximately 1300 members of the Dalit or 'untouchable' caste. The Dalits beat drums and performed traditional dances to symbolically resist the highly exclusionary spatial and bodily politics that limit their movements within Indian society. Traditionally, Dalits could not enter public spaces except for during the hottest midday period, and only after beating drums to announce their presence to members of higher castes. Appropriating the drums as a source of pride at the WSF was a celebration of freedom and inclusion that simultaneously recognized their history of oppression (Smith et al, 2008).</p><p>Given that the rejection of neoliberal globalization is a nominal prerequisite to participate, it is not surprising that the overwhelming majority of participants at Social Forums are left of center in their political orientation. The goal of global social justice and democracy is common to most participants. Internal political and ideological tensions arise not from assessing the value of this goal in itself, but rather what global social justice and democracy should look like and what methods should be used to achieve it. For example, is positive change best achieved through negotiation within existing political and financial institutions of global governance, or must the entire system be radically restructured to make democratic decision-making possible at all? In principle, the WSF offers many opportunities for debate and the possibility to work together of many divergent and seemingly incommensurable groups. Jeffrey Juris outlines a helpful theoretical road map of the divergent social and ideological characteristics of various (often overlapping and fluid) participants of the Social Forum (2008). Institutional actors, operating within formal democratic structures like parties, unions and professional NGOs, seek reform through concrete formal participation in electoral politics and use the Social Forum to generate policy proposals to promote their implementation. Traditional leftists like Marxists or Trotskyists espouse state-centered revolutionary strategies and seek concrete reform only if it causes structural change. In contrast, network-based movements of grassroots activists are often direct-action orientated and not as concerned with state-centered radical anti-capitalism but rather decentralized and participatory forms of organization. Finally, autonomous movements like militant squatters emphasize local struggles and self-management, participate in alternative anarchist and anti-capitalist forums with networkers and promote systemic change through direct action tactics. Radicals in the traditional left, network-based movements and autonomous movements argue that capitalism must be abolished while reformists, usually institutional actors, maintain that it need only be regulated to achieve social justice. Time becomes an issue in the debate; is it possible to achieve the long-term structural change that radicals want while at the same time implement short-term reforms that can benefit the actual struggles of people today? Can reform lead to structural change, or is it merely perpetuating the status quo global economic system, making the ultimate realization of global democratic governance and social justice impossible? Can the negative effects of neoliberal globalization be ameliorated by democratic global political and economic institutions and specific reforms, or are they the necessary structural effects of the neoliberal and/or capitalist system? A further topic of deliberation concerns the relationship between social movement organizations and the state. Should movements focus their struggles on making gains in traditional electoral politics or at the grassroots? Is the role of civil society and social movement organizations solely one of creating influential public opinion and developing concrete proposals to be adopted by political parties, or should electoral politics be rejected in favor of grassroots organization and local self-management? </p><p>Both reform and radical-minded Social Forum participants have created various specific proposals for change. Reform alternatives focus on concrete institutional improvements, exemplified by the Porto Alegre Consensus and Bamako Appeal. Radical alternatives take a prefigurative form, creating models beyond the state and market systems in autonomous spaces and youth camps that realize political vision through concrete action rather than solely political discourse. Examples include squatting in abandoned buildings and unused land in order to convert them into self-managed communities, the implementation of solidarity economies and independent media like Indymedia.</p><p> </p><p>Outcomes and Effects</p><p>Within meeting space of the Social Forum event, the process of encounters, education, deliberation and contestation are to take precedence over achieving any concrete desired outcomes, as the benefit and strength of the Forum lies in its process of decentralized organization and networking rather than any policies claiming to represent the Forum. However, the Social Forum process has had innumerable concrete outcomes as it disseminates into the everyday actions and political consciousnesses of participants and organizations.</p><p>For example, the first World Social Forum established the Global Network of the Solidarity Socioeconomy, an initiative towards promoting 'economic democracy' or alternative networks of collective production and distribution that can allow citizens greater control over decisions affecting how they spend their time and money. The so-called 'third sector' initiative does not primarily seek profit like the public sector or policy change like the public sector, but instead seeks to build economic relationships that reinforce 'solidarity,' or cooperative social relationships that sustain vibrant and just communities. This alternative vision of economics is critical of the social effects of economic systems that unduly encourage only competitive relationships. This alternative concept has inspired many civil society initiatives that use economic mechanisms to enact social change and create effective accountability mechanisms for multinational corporations, including the expansion of fair trade practices in agricultural imports, labour protections like the anti-sweatshop campaign, and growing food sovereignty and community agriculture practices (Miller, 2006).</p><p>The most frequently cited effect of the Social Forum process is its important role in the buildup to the largest international anti-war protest in history against the U.S.-lead war in Iraq on February 15th, 2003. The third WSF did not take an official position against the war (despite calls that it should do so), but instead provided an arena where diverse anti-war organizations from around the world could converge in order to orchestrate their upcoming mobilization. Further, the WSF was a pedagogical and deliberative space where new comprehensive analyses could be formed linking the Iraq war with neoliberal globalization. This built worldwide opinion against both neoliberalism and the war in Iraq. The Social Forum process has also facilitated numerous other demonstrations, including the G8 summit protests.</p><p>Since the Forum has no unified agenda, some effects are unintended and contentious amongst some of the more radical participants. For example, initial Forums were instrumental in organizing Brazilian social movements and NGOs to support and help elect Lula da Silva, a former radical union leader and member of Brazil’s Workers Party, to that country’s Presidency in October of 2002. Those who are critical of political parties and wish to maintain the Forum as a meeting of civil society interpret this as an instance of the exploitation of the process by politicians as a tool for electoral gain. However, reform-minded participants are more willing to use the Forum to help elect politicians. The reform and radical factions of the Social Forum process are similarly divided regarding the increasing legitimacy of many WSF themes, like debt relief, socially-minded investment, and equitable globalization with global economic powers, including the World Economic Forum (Byrd, 2005). The participation of traditional political parties and governments in the Social Forum process remains a contentious issue, depending upon whether the role of civil society should be understood as primarily to influence concrete policy or rather as an alternative to inherently undemocratic organizations that seek electoral gain rather than social justice [11].</p><p>Examples</p><p>The rapid proliferation of the Social Forum process at all levels means that this list should be taken as a sampling of notable cases and by no means exhaustive of all past or planned Social Forums.   </p><p class=""TableSection"">Table 1</p><p class=""FigureCaptionLabel"">World Social Forums</p><p>National Social Forums have occured in numerous countries around the globe. The first United States Social Forum (USSF) took place in <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta"">Atlanta</a> in June 2007. Detroit, Michigan hosted USSF 2010 from June 22nd until the 26th. The most recent Canadian Social Forum was held in Windsor, Ontario from June 18th to the 20th, 2010.</p><p> </p><p>Past and planned instances of local and thematic Social Forums are often too numerous to list and more difficult to track and document systemically because they are organized autonomously by local communities that do not necessarily need to use the Internet to publicize their organizing efforts. However, some thematic Social Forums planned around the WSF 2010 are organized around the topics of solidarity economies, early childhood and youth education, urban issues, the collective rights of peoples, alternatives to the financial crisis, community radio, labour issues, environment, migration and food security.</p><p>Analysis and Criticism</p><p>1. Although the Social Forum process claims to be 'open space,' participating organizations and individuals must adhere to the Charter of Principles that unconditionally rejects neoliberal and militarized economic globalization. These rules specify who is and is not welcome in the space. If the Charter of Principles defines an inside and an outside to the Social Forum, then the space is defined by excluding not only those who are proponents of neoliberalism, but also those, no doubt in the vast majority, who remain uninformed about global economics and politics and/or have not yet formulated a definite opinion (Nunes, 2005). If the Forum is indeed restricted to include only those who already have a clear and defined position, it seems a stretch to consider it a truly open or deliberative space. This is not only a problem that creates logical or moral contradictions within the Forum, but it may also create political and strategic obstacles to its realization of global social justice (Sen, 2004). It seems unlikely that changing the neoliberal order is a task manageable by the distinct minority of individuals and organizations who have already taken committed positions against it. Democratic political struggle and debate seems to require at least a minimum engagement with the arguments of those who hold opposing opinions in order to deepen analysis and elaborate effective strategy. Further, the all-important critical mass demanding global democracy and social justice will never be realized unless the Social Forum process reaches out to the vast majority of the public who remain uninformed and unsure of their positions on the issue in an attempt to win their support. Unless the Social Forum process makes a point to expand public engagement, it runs the risk of remaining an insular space for like-minded civil society organizations and individuals. The Forum must protect against becoming merely a nominally democratic process driven primarily by ideology. Although it is a small first step in this direction, perhaps it may be prudent to change the wording of the Charter and extend an invitation to not only those who are ""opposed to neo-liberalism"" but rather to those who are 'concerned with' or even 'affected by' dominant trends of economic globalization.</p><p>2. There are many heated debates surrounding the organizational architecture of the Social Forum itself. Problems that contribute to the perception of the Social Forum as an undemocratic space include a lack of transparency in decision-making, hierarchical organization and the privileging of the more well-known and consolidated actors at the Forum at the expense of smaller, grassroots and/or radical organizations (Osterweil, 2009). Though the Forum formally rejects political hierarchy, this does not entail a practical absence of hierarchy since informal hierarchical structures are not prevented and may even be encouraged. Organizations and individuals with greater skill, finances or pre-existing networks may come to unduly dominate the Social Forum. The role of the Committees (e.g. the International Committee and the Brazilian Organizing Committee) that organize Forum events have been widely criticized for this reason. As the Social Forum process becomes more diffused, it is becoming established practice that each particular event must establish an organizing committee. Of particular concern is the potential privileging of activities scheduled by the organizing committee as opposed to Forum activities organized by the participants themselves. Chico Whitaker has argued that self-organized activities ""are almost looked down upon as secondary, less important activities that hold low prestige, almost as if they were a burden that the organizers are forced to carry"" as opposed to the themes and celebrity lecturers that are the 'showcase' of the Forum (Whitaker, 2003).</p><p>The debate surrounding the appropriate role of organizing committees points to a larger problem for the Social Forum, namely, how to remain an open, deliberative and pedagogical space while still facilitating action. Representative structures and central command are seen as hierarchical forms of organization that should be replaced with horizontal, decentralized coordination, open participation and transparent decision-making. Network-based radical organizations have rejected their invitation to become part of the International Committee, stating they are ""part of a new political culture involving network-based organizational forms, direct democracy, open participation, and direct action. A top-down process, involving a closed, non-transparent, non-democratic, and highly institutional central committee will never attract collectives and networks searching for a new way of doing politics"" (Juris, 2005: 260) [12]. The contradiction of the Forum process is that realizing the goals of open space and participation seem to practically require non-open space like committees to carry out basic organizational, logistic and administrative duties. The practical experiences of alternative horizontal organization in building collective processes and managing internal struggles has been frustrating to some members of the Social Forum, particularly those who want the Forum to move beyond being a deliberative space for civil society and towards unified political action. This requires revising the Charter-imposed inability to issue political statements on behalf of the Forum itself, to speak with a unified purpose. This tension was expressed with the 2005 ‘Porto Alegre Consensus’. Nineteen prominent intellectuals(pejoratively labeled the G19) created a twelve-point list of proposals that were widely discussed at the Forum, including debt cancellation and the democratization of international institutions, and called on other participants at the Forum to sign on despite having had no participation in the creation of the manifesto. This was interpreted by some as a draft of a political platform seeking to represent the opinion of the Forum in defiance of the Charter of Principles. A member of the Brazilian Organizing Committee, Candido Grzybowski, rejected the proposal despite agreeing with its contents because ""it goes against the very spirit of the Forum. Here, all proposals are equally important and not only that of a group of intellectuals, even when they are very significant persons"" (Glasius, 2005).</p><p>Whitaker argues that the Forum must remain a deliberative space rather than a political actor in order to retain its open, free, horizontal structure, and that any attempt to mobilize the Forum itself will necessarily compromise this. Whitaker further argues the WSF has ""no leaders. It is only a place, basically a horizontal space... It is like a public square without an owner."" The Forum should be a 'factory of ideas,' developing independent and diverse movements rather than becoming one in its own right. The Forum ought not direct movements and organizations, but only support the creation of more and more Forum spaces (Whitaker, 2003). In response, others have argued that it is naive to view the WSF as a flat, horizontal space devoid of internal power relations and external power in its own right. The realization of pure horizontality is a practical and logical failure due to its inherent contradictions. For example, the opening of spaces with a Charter of Principles proceeds by exclusion of those with divergent opinions on neoliberalism. Further, external factors like material conditions distort horizontal networks from the outside. Existing hierarchies are informally replicated within the Social Forum process due to discrepancies in skill, financial resources and degree of existing networking (Nunes, 2005).</p><p>3a. Another central debate concerns the defining an appropriate relationship between the Forum and institutionalized political structures like political parties, trade unions and mainstream NGOs. The Charter of Principles formally prohibits participation by government representatives and political parties in order to maintain the Social Forums as a meeting of civil society. However, this is in conflict with the political reality of fluid boundaries between government, parties and Forums, especially as the regional and world Social Forum process grows in scale and has a necessary financial reliance on traditional state structures. Answering the question of the participation of traditional political parties and governments in the Social Forum process depends upon whether the respondent views the role of civil society as primarily to influence concrete policy or rather as necessarily autonomous alternative to those bodies. Radical Social Forum participants are critical of existing public institutions including the traditional political parties of the Left as being complacent in the neoliberal global economy. The Social Forum and traditional electoral democracy have a contrasting vision of democratic politics. Instead of voting for professional elites in order to occupy institutional positions of administrative power, radical Social Forum participants understand democratic politics as an act of engaged participation that occurs largely through one's lifestyle choices and the construction of new identities and creation of new forms of power through mechanisms of civil society. This must occur outside existing power structures, and it accounts for the prevalence of protest demonstrations, direct action tactics and prefigurative politics favoured by this engaged democratic paradigm of citizenship (Dalton, 2008). Professionalized politics is perceived as undemocratic because the opinion of the electorate is treated as an object to be manipulated in order for parties to gain political power. Thus, if parties are included, they will likely exploit the Social Forum process for electoral purposes (della Porta, 2006:216).</p><p>However, more reform-orientated participants in the Social Forum argue that formally excluding political parties may be a mistake that harms the Social Forum itself, since parties and social movement organizations are inexorably linked in practice. Even though formally excluded in the Charter, representatives have played visible and important roles in local, regional and world Social Forums. For example, the initial WSF in Porto Alegre could not have occurred without the direct sponsorship of the Worker's Party that controlled the municipal government. The injunction against political parties is rendered practically meaningless by the close relationship ehibited between the Forums and the Workers Party in Brazil, Refundazione Comunista in Italy, or the Labour Party in London (Juris, 2005:255). Further, parties can take multiple forms and be powerful political tools. Following the Charter ban without reflection can reproduce false dichotomies between civil society and parties that glosses over their variable and complex interrelationships and ignores the promise of developing new possible organizations like global 'parties' or a 'New International' (Patomaki and Teivainen, 2004). If the process remains inclusive, the Social Forum could encourage the development of a new political instrument with which to coordinate global initiatives, demanding and creating mechanisms of democratic participation in the world political order.</p><p>3b. The debate surrounding the controversial role of prominent, resource-rich NGOs like church, poverty and development organizations at the Social Forum was particularly acute in Nairobi 2007, where the Forum was taking place without political or financial support from local council or the Kenyan government, requiring more substantial assistance from NGOs who were quick to step in as Nairobi is the UN and aid-agency capital of east and central Africa. In Africa, the big NGOs represent the legacy of the Christian and neo-colonial politics of charity and also dominant, wealthy, capital-based societies that the WSF was established to oppose. Due to its self-organized structure of civil society organizations, the WSF 2007 presented an opportunity for people with power and money to monopolize the process. Since large-scale plenary sessions can only be organized by the Organizing Committee or a big NGO because of the high level of investment necessary, after Nairobi, the emphasis within the Forum has shifted towards smaller workshops and seminars (Dowling, 2009). For example, organizers of the first U.S. Social Forum in Atlanta, also in 2007, report that it was their intent that the driving force behind the first USSF be grassroots organizations that have been otherwise overlooked in U.S. national politics as opposed to advocacy, academics and other sectors dominating the process. The organizers were careful to take measures to mitigate the potential domination of the Forum by ""foundation-funded, majority white, centrist, and Washington-dominated NGOs and think-tanks"" (Rebick, 2007:308) This strategy was a success, as reports on the USSF featured its cultural and regional diversity (ibid).</p><p>4. As the proliferation of thematic, regional, national and local Social Forums increases, their has been debate surrounding whether these events must be 'official' or endorsed by the International Committee, or if they may use the 'Social Forum' name without explicit endorsement. In other words, as it expands globally in diverse scales and forms, should the 'Social Forum' be franchised or public domain? Must organizers, especially those of larger Forums, apply to the IC for formal recognition, or can anyone organize a Forum on the honor-system that the Charter is respected? In practice, the regional level Social Forum is the most 'franchised'. Although formally independent from the IC, organization of regional Social Forums are in dialogue in planning and post-Forum stages. In contrast, local Social Forums are free to organize according to their context as long as they agree to the Charter of Principles. Recently, critics have argued that the Forum is becoming a commodity or a brand name, itself contributing to the globalization of a specific monoculture with negligable creative local reinterpretation, instead replicating the same standard recipe first developed in Porto Alegre, 2001 (Sen, 2004).</p><p>Secondary Sources  </p><p>Alvarez, Sonia, Nalu Faria and Miriam Nobre. 2009.

"<a name=""Definition"" id=""Definition""></a><h2>Definition</h2>
<p>Pop-up democracy is a term for institutional forms that use temporary, site-specific practices to provide opportunities for increased local political and civic participation.
</p>
<a name=""Purpose"" id=""Purpose""></a><h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>The idea of pop-up democracy is built on the notion that the trend in urban social design towards temporary, small-scale installations provides opportunities for expanding the dynamics and spaces of civic discourse in our communities. By doing so it is a tool for creating an increased ""culture of participation.""  It also satisfies an urge among planning practitioners to envision impermanent solutions in unsure times, a form of development that allows for flexibility and change over time.
</p><p>Another essential component of pop-up democracy is its opportunity to resist ""the threshold problem.""  The Threshold Problem refers to the challenge that many institutions, including schools, often face in getting members of the public to enter the door of the building. This could be due to the nature of the facade itself: many institutions are located in buildings once considered suitably grand but now forbidding and uninviting. It could also be due to the unwillingness of institutions to make visitors feel welcome;  However, the threshold problem can also be the result of social or cultural barriers.  This might keep them from crossing the threshold to participate in the life of the institution, regardless of whether or not the institution attempts to bring them in.
In all of these scenarios, the institution is shown to be not a neutral space. It is rather a space in which some participants feel comfortable, while others might feel unwelcome. It is a place to which some have access, and and to which others do not. It is these power imbalances, implicit in the location, physical form, and culture of the school, which the pop-up democracy will resist, by subverting spatial dynamics of power.
</p><p>Current pop-up efforts in the arts and social entrepreneurship have begun to create exciting and new dynamics of space and experience of the urban environment.  Though as art and commerce projects most of these efforts are designed to produce varying levels of social capital or civic discussion, many of the techniques employed through these projects could provide dynamic and fruitful opportunities to pursue expressly political and democratic ends.  Temporary installations enable experimentation with different ways of seeing power and how it is manifested spatially.  They also encourage residents and planners to imagine multiple trajectories and uses for a space, rather than considering it static because it is in a building.  Pop-up democracy serves a need for the community; when it no longer serves, it no longer exists.
</p><p>The goal of developing a structure or framework of pop-up democracy is to provide local opportunities for direct interaction with the data, skills, and ideas community members need in order to be able to be informed and successful participants in planning and political processes.
</p>
<a name=""Current_Practices"" id=""Current_Practices""></a><h2>Current Practices</h2>
<p>Current practices in temporary, site-specific interventions exist primarily in the public art and ""cultural production"" fields.  Within these fields, projects fall within a (not-at-all-exhaustive) number of categories.
</p><p>- Inserted vs. modular interventions: Inserted interventions occur in vacant storefronts or existing homes, for example; because they exist within the current built environment these projects tend to be of longer duration.  Modular interventions, such as food trucks which can move within a single day, or other kinds of ""pods"", are more flexible and usually are located in the public realm, whether in a right-of-way or a square.  Farmers' markets and craft markets are somewhere in between these two categories: they occur regularly but are not permanent fixtures in the built environment landscape.
</p><p>- Food as medium of exchange: Current trends in cultural practice frequently revolve around the idea of food as a form of cultural exchange or as a building block of community identity.  Such projects can be undertaken in the form of events and programming (""convivial"" practice) or commerce (food not bombs, temporary food stores).
</p><p>- Passive use intervention:  Passive use interventions require that participants do nothing but experience them.  Mobile or temporary open spaces are a key example of this trend.
</p><p>- Pop-up shops:  Pop-up shops, like markets, provide temporary opportunities for targeted commerce, often related to a larger context of events (such as a jewelry store in a vacant storefront during New York Fashion Week), or at regular intervals.  Pop-up shops often serve an expressly social function, acting as a kind of “mobile party” venue.
</p><p>- ""Learning insertion"":  This author’s term for temporary projects dedicated to expressly educational ends.  Temporary libraries, publicly installed computers, alternative pedagogy spaces and skill-share booths, for example, would exemplify this term.  Learning insertions come closest in objective and product to providing a model for pop-up democracy, since the emphasis is on providing skills in a neutral environment that places teacher and student on an equal footing and transforms the spatial implications of education.
</p><p>- Activist spaces:  Like learning insertions, activist spaces begin to approach the goals of pop-up democracy.  Artist protest tents and sheds are one example of activist spaces, directly inserting resistance into a built environment of power such as a government building or prominent public square.  Another activist space concept is a “neutral” or “demonstration” space, where community members create alternate structures where they control dialogue and power brokers must be invited inside.  Like learning insertions, these spaces destabilize spatial power dynamics in order to reframe deliberation.
</p>
<a name=""Critiques"" id=""Critiques""></a><h2>Critiques</h2>
<p>Though inspirational as a model for mediating spatial power dynamics and creating locally-appropriate sites of learning and exchange, many pop-up projects are envisioned as public space enliveners, or as aesthetic artistic practices, do not satisfactorily achieve a social or political intent as with a true institution.  Some sources of critique are:
</p><p>- Urbanism and temporality are trendy.  Thus, many of these projects while interesting and useful from an urban environment perspective are essentially social or aesthetic in nature, rather than transformational.
</p><p>-  Furthermore, many of these projects, being interesting to other urbanists doing their own similar projects and sharing similar goals, ultimately create bonding rather than bridging social capital.  They reinforce existing social dynamics, perpetuating experimentation only within an “artist” class rather than in the communities they intend to engage.
</p><p>-  As arts projects, many pop-up interventions do not have any framework for measuring success.  As a result there is little emphasis on collecting or disseminating data, either about their project or to the community throughout the project.  Some projects particularly in the learning and activist fields do create markers and measures of success, and doing so predicts that they will be more likely to have it.
</p><p>- While many pop-up projects are extremely culturally specific, many others are not and seem only to exist because their creators imagined them.  The most successful projects, on the other hand, take the spatial and cultural context of the site and project as part of the core of the project.
</p><p>- Some projects create a problematic delineation between practitioners or creators, and “receivers” or participants.  As a result such projects fail to capitalize on the potential for pop-up interventions to be destabilizing to the status quo.
</p><p>- Consumption is not participation.
</p>
<a name=""Principles_of_Pop-up_Democracy"" id=""Principles_of_Pop-up_Democracy""></a><h2>Principles of Pop-up Democracy</h2>
<p>Based on analysis and critique of current practices, we can create a basic framework for successful pop-up democracy.
</p>
<ul><li> Passive use is not participation: input and decision making are necessary to enliven a project.
</li><li> Both producers and users of these spaces must be engaged in making a product.
</li><li> Projects should produce bonding and bridging social capital through site choice and outreach methods.
</li><li> Spaces should physically or conceptually mediate power structures by creating invited or oppositional spaces.
</li><li> Data collection, evaluation and dissemination are essential.
</li><li> The project must have clearly articulated goals and measures of success. 
</li><li> Spaces that provide services or goods of use will produce higher participation yields.
</li><li> Projects must be intensely context-specific: need comes first, project comes second.
</li></ul><a name=""Further_Research"" id=""Further_Research""></a><h2>Further Research</h2>
<p>This conceptual framework must now be tested by experiments in pop-up democracy.  These experiments could begin to provide social goods, information necessary to political participation, or groundings for dialogue between communities and power brokers in neutral environments.  By focusing on project outcomes and evaluation the framework can then be evaluated and amended to maximize the potential of pop-up democracy in many contexts.
</p><p>Specific areas of focus could include: what levels of complexity and polarization can this method of public participation support?  What is the optimal duration and format of insertion based on context and issue addressed?  Is it sufficient for these interventions to produce a ""culture of participation,"" or should they be directly focused towards decision making?

"<p><a id=""Definition"" name=""Definition""></a>Cabildo Abierto (pluralized as Cabildos Abiertos), translates as ""Open Town Council."" It is a form of deliberative meeting that has used in South and Central America beginning in the 16th Century. The Cabildo Abierto was originally used to assemble citizens in case of emergencies and disasters. They also served as town hall meetings, and still do today.</p><h2>Definition</h2><p>These open meetings were called by the Cabildo (translated as ""council""), the official government in towns and states. The ""Abierto"" portion of the name signifies the inclusion of the public. The Cabildo itself is an actual governing body with officials and leaders. Cabildo Abierto meetings gave the public a chance to vote on various issues that were important in their city and state. Political officials would meet with representatives of the public to come to an agreement on how to solve various issues. Cabildo Abiertos are still held periodically in South America and Central America, and are still considered effective and efficient in resolving all sorts of issues.</p><p><a id=""Problems_and_Purpose"" name=""Problems_and_Purpose""></a></p><h2>Problems and Purpose</h2><p>Problems--The Cabildo Abierto did have some notable problems. It was not a complete democracy, and it tended to exclude people from the lower classes. Poor Criollos and Mestizos (people of mixed descent), Indians, women and slaves were not allowed to participate in the Cabildo Abierto. Only people of pure or nearly pure Spanish Ancestry were allowed to participate in the Cabildo Abierto. In addition, the most wealthy and fit members of society were considered to be more worthy of participating in the Catildo Abierto than the working class.</p><p>Although there was some favoritism in choosing the members who would participate in the Cabildo Abierto, it was still seen as a major step toward Democracy in Latin America because the voice of the people was expressed to the colonizers, who reported to the official Cabildo of the colony, who in turn, reported to the King of Spain's representative in Latin America. This was seen as progress. However, the views of the rich and the purebloods tended to be more elitist and did not always favor the poor classes in different colonies. In fact, the poor class was not favored at all. Many of the rich and elite class in Latin America at this time owned slaves. There was very little equality. Racism actually played a sizable part in the Cabildo Abierto. At these meetings, topics often involved such things as how to deal with Indian slaves.</p><p>Also, the power the Cabildos Abiertos held varied in each community:</p><p>""Subservience to royal administrators was most prominent in the 'capital towns,' or the seats of the audiencias and the viceroy. In the hinterland and on the frontier, where the population was forced to rely on its resourcefulness for subsistence and protection against foreigners and hostile aborigines, the cabildos sometimes evinced force and independence in the handling of municipal affairs."" <a href=""#cite_note-0"" title="""">[1]</a></p><p>Basically, when prominent authorities such as the viceroy or royal administrators were on hand, the Cabildo Abierto was likely to have a weaker impact on issues. But in more remote areas, the high authorities generally did not attend meetings. This made it easier for the the people to have an impact and get what they wanted. The fact that effectiveness varied, and that citizens views were generally overlooked at Cabildos Abiertos in the high population capitals was a problem. That meant the majority of the people were not always able to make their voices heard.</p><p>Purpose--The purpose of the Cabildo Abierto was to get the viewpoint of the citizens on issues that were important to the people. These issues involved elections, defense and security issues, and the allocation of funds: ""Subsequent sections set out in like fashion the sometimes obscure role of the Cabildo Abierto in the election of local officials (including such worthies as governors and a bishop), discussion of municipal religious observances, the voting of gifts of money to the crown, and measures for communal defense against pirates, indians and epidemics."" <a href=""#cite_note-1"" title="""">[2]</a> They were considered to be a democratic institution that the South American and Central American cities and provinces used as a way to express opinions and feelings.</p><p>Cabildos Abiertos also served as a form of reunions, where people throughout the community would go with their neighbors. People would get together to talk and decide about what issues they considered relevant. Until the 16th century, Cabildos Abiertos were used to elect governors and other officials. Later on, the meetings became more like a town hall, where people would show up to deliberate and participate in discussions about important topics with neighbors such as defense, budgeting, and keep the government honest and in check.</p><p><a id=""History"" name=""History""></a></p><h2>History</h2><p>The first Cabildo Abierto was believed to have been held on June 10, 1541 in Chile. The mayor of Santiago had called a meeting to elect a new governor of the region. Rumors of the Spanish Conquistador and explorer Francisco Pizarro being killed in Peru had necessitated an election. The Cabildo Abierto met and nominated Pedro De Valdivia to be the governor of the province. de Valdivia accepted the nomination and was awarded power of council and assembly. He accepted and became the first governor elected by the people in Latin or South America via Cabildo Abierto.(Moore,129)<a href=""#cite_note-Moore-2"" title="""">[3]</a></p><p>John Moore writes about the history in ""The Cabildo in Peru Under The Hapsburgs"", saying ""The Cabildo Abierto had its roots in the popular concejos of the Castilian towns of the Middle ages, which were a more or less fixed feature of their political life, and despite the hostility of the monarchy flourished in some regions of the Peninsula as late as the 19th century. Like other European customs and habits it was transplanted to the New World during the early period of exploration and discovery."" (Moore 125) <a href=""#cite_note-Moore-2"" title="""">[3]</a>. The Cabildo Abierto served as a way to bring the community together. It was evident that the Spanish conquerors brought the custom of meeting in this way to South America. As Moore mentioned, it is not hard to find similarities between the Cabildo Abierto and ""El Concejo Abierto Castellano-Leones,"" the Spanish version of municipal councils. El Concejo had been practiced for centuries in Spain. The meeting and reunion aspect of the Cabildo Abierto was especially useful when nominating as well as electing public officials. Cabildos Abiertos were also used to discuss issues of money and civil rights, as well health and diseases epidemics that were traveling through South and Latin America at the time. This was especially important in cities because living conditions were often unclean and disease had the tendency to spread quickly in that day and age. Public debates would be had among the residents and a vote would take place. Governors were often elected via Cabildo Abierto. In the 16th century, some colonies lost that privilege after failed uprisings. After that, the meetings continued, but more as a forum to discuss issues and hold town hall meetings to discuss topics of general interest. These topics were not always extremely important, but the Cabildo Abierto was a way to bring the people of the town together.</p><p>Modern Cabildos Abiertos are held in places where many people can gather. They are held often in town squares, churches, and schools. They are far more organized than they used to be, but they are still relatively informal. Modern Cabildos Abiertos do sometimes have set meeting schedules, with speakers and an itinerary though, when the first ones did not. Sometimes there is even food or entertainment (such as musical guests) at the Cabildo Abierto. Cabildos Abiertos are often called by presidential candidates as a means to connect with people and spread their message. A Cabildo Abierto can be called by pretty much any authority, as it is just a general meeting. Turnouts vary depending on the cause, but it still serves as a way to organize people, which was the original goal.</p><p><a id=""Participant_Selection"" name=""Participant_Selection""></a></p><h2>Participant Selection</h2><p>In the earliest Cabildos Abiertos, the participants included the Governor, the Mayor or other municipal authority, and members of the church in addition to the people of the city. In respect to the citizens, it was hard to determine what number of them were chosen to participate in the Cabildo Abierto. In the first Cabildos Abiertos held in South America, the number of citizens who attended this meetings was very high. As time went on, the numbers began to decline. However, official tallies were never taken at meetings to document the number of citizens that participated. This demonstrates that the Cabildos Abiertos did not have any real structure, instead, they were operated according to customs and cultural norms of the time. There was no official parliamentary house that they were held it, nor was it a structured event in any way. Each Cabildo was different, and was catered to the topic at hand. This informal atmosphere allowed the participants at the meeting to express their feelings and opinions about the current issue being discussed.</p><p>As time went on, there was some debate about who should be allowed to participate in Cabildos Abiertos<a class=""external autonumber"" href=""http://docencia.udea.edu.co/derecho/constitucion/cabildo_abierto.html"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""http://docencia.udea.edu.co/derecho/constitucion/cabildo_abierto.html"">[1]</a>. Indians and Mestizos who lived in the city generally did not participate. There was no actual document that forbid Indians and Mestizos, but the Cabildos Abiertos were never promoted to those two groups, and they were discouraged from coming. There was a strong racist feeling towards these groups from the Spanish and Criollos.</p><p>Article 9, Law 134 (of 1994) of the Colombian constitution declares the rules of the Cabildo Abierto. There is a legal process that is used to call the Cabildo Abierto in Colombia, and the constitution necessitates by law that at least 5 members per thousand (0.05%) of the electorate in question must show up to the Cabildo Abierto. Civil organizations can also call Cabildos Abiertos and make them community events. The racism that once dictated who showed up to Cabildos Abiertos does not play much of a factor in these meetings today. Any person that interested in attending a Cabildo Abierto can go to one. Colombian Cabildos Abiertos work differently than those throughout much of Latin America. A speaker is appointed by those who call the Cabildo Abierto, and only he can speak in front of the crowd. However, others may also speak to the crowd and present as long as they sign in at least 3 days before the Cabildo and present a summary of their argument to the party calling the Cabildo Abierto. Anyone can participate in the deliberation, and a decision is made by a representative of the corporation/civil organization or person who called the Cabildo Abierto. These meetings in Colombia tend to be more formal and organized than the Cabildos Abiertos throughout the rest of Latin America.</p><p><a id=""Deliberations.2C_Decisions.2C_and_Public_Interaction"" name=""Deliberations.2C_Decisions.2C_and_Public_Interaction""></a></p><h2>Deliberations, Decisions, and Public Interaction</h2><p>Deliberation at the first Cabildos was generally good but did not always have a huge impact on political outcome. Often, those with power would be willing to hear the voice of the people, but they would still generally make their own decisions. The amount of citizens that actually showed up at a Cabildo Abierto varied widely depending on the issue being discussed. Also, the figure of authority could decide if invitations to the Cabildo Abierto were to be extended to all citizens or only a certain number. Elitism was sometimes shown in the invitations to the Cabildo Abierto, which could limit the effectiveness and scope of the deliberation and public interaction. Adding to this, Moore asks and answers the question, ""To what extent were these assemblies deliberative entities with authority independent and separate from that of the regular cabildos? No categorical answer can be given to the question, yet in most instances they were clearly subordinate to the corporations."" (Moore, 134) <a href=""#cite_note-Moore-2"" title="""">[3]</a></p><p>It is hard to say just how much impact that the Cabildos Abiertos had on decision making within the regular Cabildo (the official governing body), but at least it provided the people with an opportunity to make their voice heard, which they had not always been able to do. Moore does add, ""It would seem that free and uncensored discussions took place and that any citizen might give his opinion on the subject before the body."" (Moore, 134)<a href=""#cite_note-Moore-2"" title="""">[3]</a>. Citizens were allowed to express their own opinions without punishment, which was not always allowed at the time. This was a major step forward for deliberation in the 15th century. Also, as time went on, Cabildos Abiertos became much more powerful. Nicaragua, Peru, Argentina and Nueva Grenada all declared their independence via Cabildos Abiertos. These meetings carried real weight in the 19th and 20th century and still do today.</p><p>Most South American countries are very centralized, and there is a sizable disconnect between state government in the capitals and local governments in the towns that are located farther out. Cabildos Abiertos are a popular way to gather people in these smaller areas and get them involved in local government. These meetings are generally well attended and let people in these smaller towns know about what is going on in state government and how this affects local government. Debate and deliberation are often had at Cabildos Abiertos. They make people aware of lawmaking and current issues at hand. Current Cabildos Abiertos also serve as a way to keep a system of checks and balances.</p><p>John Gastil's book ""Political Communication and Deliberation"" <a href=""#cite_note-3"" title="""">[4]</a> defines criteria for success of the analytic process of deliberation in 5 categories: Creating a solid information base, prioritizing the key values at stake, identifying a broad range of solutions, weighing the pros, cons and tradeoffs among solutions and making the best decision possible. Cabildos Abiertos attempt to satisfy all of these criteria. They create a solid information base by allowing organizations and government and private citizens as well to state their opinions on issues that are important in the community. Citizens who attend a Cabildo Abierto are given the opportunity to deliberate and hear others deliberate as well, which strengthens their information base and level of knowledge on the local issues being discussed. This information base and level of knowledge allows them to use their opinion to prioritize the key values at stake and identify a broad range of solutions. The Cabildo Abierto starts a process that provides the foundation for successful deliberation within Gastil's formula. Once the key values have been prioritized and a broad range of solutions has been discussed, members of the Cabildo Abierto can discuss pros, cons and tradeoffs among solutions and make the best decision possible. The process of the Cabildo Abierto from start to finish covers all of these deliberative criteria,</p><p><a id=""Outcomes_and_Effects"" name=""Outcomes_and_Effects""></a></p><h2>Outcomes and Effects</h2><p>Cabildos Abiertos originally helped to integrate local people with colonizers, but over time, they became a means to unify the country. As mentioned, Latin American countries are very centralized, and Cabildos Abiertos served as a way to make rural people aware of large-scale issues that started in the cities and other areas of their countries. They serve many functions. Countries have used them to declare independence, for example. They help raise awareness about points of concern for citizens of all classes and races. A Cabildo Abierto is very valuable because it can keep leaders and members of government aware of what is really important to the citizens. Having a forum for people to have their voices heard is always necessary in any democracy, and Cabildos Abiertos allow the people of Latin America to express their concerns and feelings and give them a say in the political process of their country.</p><p><a id=""Examples"" name=""Examples""></a></p><h2>Examples</h2><p>There is a long history of significant events happening at Cabildos Abiertos. As mentioned before in 1541, in Santiago, Chile. Pedro Valdivia was elected governor of Chile after a series of Cabildos Abiertos due to rumors that Francisco Pizarro had died in Peru. The Spanish conquerors of Chile did not want to award the governorship to anyone without merit, or anyone who would go against their wishes. Conquerors are generally not Democratic. By even holding the Cabildo Abierto, progress was made toward representative democracy. By holding a Cabildo Abierto, the conquerors showed the citizens of Chile that they were not necessarily trying to oppress them. This was an attempt to introduce some sort of political structure to Chile.</p><p>As time went on, Cabildos Abiertos became more democratic and open. Open deliberation began to take place between the people and the Spanish conquerors in the various colonies. In Asuncion, Paraguay many governors were also elected at these kinds of popular assemblies. Over a 200 year period, starting in 1548, when the incumbent died or suffered a mysterious death or disappearance (at the hand of the Conquerors), the Cabildo Abierto of all the neighbors of Ascunsion were charged with electing new governors. King Carlos V of Spain was considered to be the leader of the colonies. Paraguay had the most privelege bestowed upon their Cabildos Abierto. They actually had a Democratic system in place. In most colonies, a governor could be selected by the people but King Carlos V had the power to override the decision. In Paraguay, the people elected their own governor with almost any outside interference. This signified the beginning of a more democratic structure. However, this privelege given by King Carlos V was lost after a revolution was attempted by the commoners, who did not believe the king's power should exceed that of the people's will.</p><p>In Cuba, Cabildos Abiertos worked differently. Citizens could propose two candidates for municipal elections in addition to the one who was nominated by the governor. The ""regidores,"" who were part of local Cuban government, would also propose 2 more candidates. 5 candidates in total were nominated, and the election happened at the Cabildo Abierto. Cabildos Abiertos were used in the cities like Havana until the mid-1550's <a href=""#cite_note-Tapia-4"" title="""">[5]</a>. These kinds of public elections of officials only lasted until the 16th century in the Spanish colonies such as the Antillas, Panama, Quito, Lima, Santiago and Cuzco. However, some of the other Spanish colonies and cities like Guatemala, Caracas, Pamplona, Potosi and Buenos Aires and Ascunsion continued to elect at least some of their own officials via Cabildos Abiertos, because there was a more democratic (relative to most of the Spanish colonies) system in place in these areas. <a href=""#cite_note-5"" title="""">[6]</a> For example, the people of Santiago de Cali, in Nueva Granada held a Cabildo Abierto in a church to organize a protest to the Audience of the Quito (which was a political assembly in Nueva Granada) against Spanish commissioner Medina, who was sent to Cali to check the money and treasure accounts of royalty in the colony. He was accused of committing injustices against the people of the colony. The audience heard the protest and discharged the commissioner and sent him away from the colony. This is an example of Cabildo Abierto that was heard by the authorities, and made a difference in local politics. Cabildos Abiertos had the potential to make a difference. <a href=""#cite_note-6"" title="""">[7]</a>The citizens of Havana also met in Cabildos Abiertos to discuss issues such as how to improve city defense against potential attacks from pirates. This was a major issue in Havana and many other countries in Spanish and Latin America. Many Cabildos Abiertos were held to discuss topics like these.</p><p>In the 19th century, when many colonies were declaring independence from Spain, Cabildos Abiertos were vital tools to organizing and promoting freedom and resistance. When the Criollos decided it was time to form their own nations, they spread the word via Cabildo Abierto. This ended up being a vital tool to many Latin American and South American countries in separating from Spain. For example, in the capital of Nueva Granada, independence was proclaimed in a famous Cabildo Abierto on July 10, 1810. It was called by citizens against the will of the Viceroy, who was needed in Nueva Granada to approve any Cabildo Abierto. The citizens met anyway, and declared a rebellion and declared Nueva Granada's independence against Spain.(Tapia, 64) <a href=""#cite_note-Tapia-4"" title="""">[5]</a> Similar events took place in Nicaragua on December 22, 1811, Argentina on May 21, 1810 (which influenced the uprisings in Nueva Granada and Peru) on and Peru on July 28, 1821. All countries declared independence via Cabildos Abiertos.</p><p>Also, Cabildos Abiertos are held today. An example was found of a recent one in Esperanza, Argentina on February 12, 2010. Important Argentine officials such as the Secretary of Government, Secretary of Public Service, and the Secretary of Finance showed up to meet with the people to discuss the public's awareness of the financial situation that the city was in. They presented tax and budget proposals to the people of Esperanza and held discussions and took questions, much like a town hall meeting would go in America. Cabildos Abiertos are still being used today to solve a wide range of issues and make citizens aware of what the options are.

However, some problems that the Cabildos Abiertos did have in the early stages (approx. 16th-19th century) were things like racism, lack of inclusion of all citizens, and the king or governor's ability to override the will of the people and make a decision that does not necessarily have the citizens' best interests in mind. The Cabildo Abierto was always a good way to make voices heard, but the elite and the ""pure-bloods"" did not always share the same interests that the working class did. In addition, when the will of the people was overruled by authority, then the Cabildo Abierto that was held to discuss the issue became worthless. Some rulers were better at listening to the will of the people than others, though. However, when one decided to completely disregard the popular opinions of the citizens, the purpose of the Cabildo Abierto was disrespected.</p><p>Modern Cabildos Abiertos are more fair, as Latin American countries are mostly democratic. When a Cabildo Abierto is called today, it is done so with the genuine desire to hear the voice of the people. Cabildos Abiertos have grown over time and the deliberation and fairness of the meetings are stronger than ever. Also, local government was very detached from central government in the years of the first Cabildos Abiertos. With the advent of modern technology, Cabildos Abiertos can connect to central government much better and centralized issues become national topics of debate.</p><p><a id=""Secondary_Sources"" name=""Secondary_Sources""></a></p><h2>Secondary Sources</h2><ol class=""references""><li id=""cite_note-0""><a href=""#cite_ref-0"" title="""">↑</a> Gil, John.

"<p><a id=""Definition"" name=""Definition""></a></p><h2>Definition</h2><p>""Deliberation Day - a new national holiday."" <a href=""#cite_note-0"" title="""">[1]</a> With this statement Bruce Ackerman and James Fishkin were the first to propose Deliberation Day (DDay) as a method for having citizens deliberating 2 weeks before the national elections for 2 days to have a better understanding of their most important issues, and to determine which candidates associate with their most valued issue. By conducting Deliberative Polls, Bruce Ackerman and James Fishkin have created a structural format for Deliberation Day, which starts from small town meetings, to televised debates, and to larger citizen assemblies. Eventually, by the end of this new national holiday, millions of citizens who were not able to attend the assemblies will still recognize issues that were discussed by reviewing the discussions through the Internet and televised media.</p><p><a id=""History"" name=""History""></a></p><h2>History</h2><p>Bruce Ackerman and James Fishkin had proposed Deliberation Day after assessing researches about modern public opinion. Their evaluation concluded how the public's ignorance on politics was quite negative. Citizens consider gaining political information as a ""time-consuming business,"" and put priority on personal consumptions. <a href=""#cite_note-1"" title="""">[2]</a> The most serious problem lies within citizens gaining information through televisions and the Internet, where numerous unreliable sources exist. Still, Bruce Ackerman and James Fishkin argue how, based on their researches on Deliberative Polls, ""citizens are perfectly willing to take up the task of citizenship with appropriate settings.""<a href=""#cite_note-2"" title="""">[3]</a> As a result, Deliberation Day has been proposed for just being one possibility for this ""appropriate setting"" that citizens need.</p><p><a id=""Process"" name=""Process""></a></p><h2>Process</h2><p><a id=""Preparations"" name=""Preparations""></a></p><h3>Preparations</h3><p>Deliberation Day's preparations begin a month before, with debate organizers from the National Issues Debate asking candidates 1 to 2 issues that he, or she, considers the most important to the nation. Through this session, 2 to 4 themes will be provided for citizens to deliberate.<a href=""#cite_note-3"" title="""">[4]</a></p><p><a id=""Television_Debate"" name=""Television_Debate""></a></p><h3>Television Debate</h3><p>First, randomly selected citizens will meet in community centers, or any place that is public and accessible. They will be assigned to groups of 15 and watch televised debates of their candidates speaking about the most important issues recognized by debate organizers. After, questions will be discussed with experts on the issues and policymakers, and each participant will write questions they want to submit to the foreman of the table. The foreman will read these submitted questions in order to have citizens vote for which questions will be discussed during the larger citizen assembly.<a href=""#cite_note-4"" title="""">[5]</a></p><p><a id=""First_Citizen_Assembly"" name=""First_Citizen_Assembly""></a></p><h3>First Citizen Assembly</h3><p>Later, these small groups of 15 will join other smaller groups, creating a larger assembly of nearly 500 citizens. This will be the first citizen assembly of the day. Within this large assembly, a nonpartisan moderator will be chosen to ask the top-ranked questions taken from the citizens to local representatives of the competing political parties in the election. Through this Q and A session, the first assembly will be concluded.<a href=""#cite_note-5"" title="""">[6]</a></p><p><a id=""Second_Citizen_Assembly"" name=""Second_Citizen_Assembly""></a></p><h3>Second Citizen Assembly</h3><p>After lunch, citizens will be put back into the groups that they were in before. Within these groups, citizens will discuss if their top-ranked questions were answered adequately during the first assembly. If they were, citizens will create new questions, or they will discuss ""neglected"" questions that weren't able to be discussed due to the lack of time. The second assembly will begin at 3 p.m. following a similar format of a Q and A session between the moderator and the local representatives dealing with the neglected questions, or the new questions created.<a href=""#cite_note-6"" title="""">[7]</a></p><p><a id=""Final_Phase"" name=""Final_Phase""></a></p><h3>Final Phase</h3><p>By 4:15 p.m. citizens will have a reflecting period. The reflecting period is when citizens discuss about their impressions they had felt during the day. This includes their impressions on if their most important questions were answered, which party representative had done a better job, or if they had changed their minds due to Deliberation Day. The main point of this final session deals with citizens recognizing which issues are at stake within the nation, not voting for their final decisions on matters.</p><p>At 5 p.m. the foreman of each group will sign each participant's certificates. Although Deliberation Day is not a mandatory event, participation will be paid a stipend of $150. Deliberation Day is a 2-day event: with celebrations held throughout the nation due to the completion of deliberation on the first day, citizens will be aware, and might even participate, on the second day for setting another agenda for the national elections.<a href=""#cite_note-7"" title="""">[8]</a></p><p><a id=""Case_Studies"" name=""Case_Studies""></a></p><h2>Case Studies</h2><p>Deliberation Day is still taken consideration as a method for effective deliberation. Due to this, there are no case studies to examine if Deliberation Day had been effective. However, Bruce Ackerman and James Fishkin have conducted nearly 20 Deliberative Polls to assess how much Deliberation Day will impact citizens' ""attitudes, information, political preferences, and voting intentions."" <a href=""#cite_note-8"" title="""">[9]</a> The reason why Deliberative Polls have been assessed is because it provides the basis format for Deliberation Day: randomly selected citizens deliberate on issues in group sessions with citizens asking questions and receiving answers.</p><p><a id=""The_National_Issues_Convention_in_Austin.2C_Texas"" name=""The_National_Issues_Convention_in_Austin.2C_Texas""></a></p><h3>The National Issues Convention in Austin, Texas</h3><p>One particular Deliberative Poll Bruce Ackerman and James Fishkin regard as important is the National Issues Convention (NIC) held in Austin, Texas in January 1996. In 1996, James Fishkin had conducted the NIC, which was broadcasted by PBS (Public Broadcasting Service). During this event, randomly selected citizens deliberated on 3 issues provided by the Public Agenda: America's definition of the state of the family, the nation's economy, and America's foreign affairs. The NIC had survey respondents asking policy experts and 4 Republican candidates who were running for the national elections questions about the issues and received answers.<a href=""#cite_note-9"" title="""">[10]</a> Through this convention's assessment, James Fishkin had concluded the following points which will also apply for Deliberation Day's impact:<a href=""#cite_note-10"" title="""">[11]</a></p><ul><li>Citizens gain information.</li><li>Citizens change their opinions and vote accordingly to their changes.</li><li>Preferences do not necessarily polarize or homogenize.</li></ul><p><a id=""Evaluation"" name=""Evaluation""></a></p><h2>Evaluation</h2><p><a id=""The_Positives"" name=""The_Positives""></a></p><h3>The Positives</h3><p>With the points assessed from the Deliberative Poll experiments, James Fishkin has stated major positive outcomes of Deliberation Day:</p><ul><li>Deliberation makes a difference.<a href=""#cite_note-11"" title="""">[12]</a> Through sustained and structured conversations, citizens have replied how such informing events have changed their opinions and votes significantly.</li><li>Deliberation creates balance.<a href=""#cite_note-12"" title="""">[13]</a> Before citizens come to discuss, they understand only one side of the issue and disagree with others. Through face-to-face discussions, this gap closes with citizens understanding both sides of the issue, although they might not necessarily agree with one of them.</li><li>Citizens begin to feel responsible for the solutions they make.<a href=""#cite_note-13"" title="""">[14]</a> Through informed discussions, citizens look beyond self-interests and consider public goods.</li></ul><p><a id=""The_Negatives"" name=""The_Negatives""></a></p><h3>The Negatives</h3><p>Despite such positive points towards effective deliberation, Deliberation Day faces several critiques in order for it to become effective in the future.</p><ul><li>Cost. Deliberation Day is an expensive event. Even Bruce Ackerman and James Fishkin consider this point critical. The estimated total budget states that if 50 million citizens participate, Deliberation Day will cost over $1.5 billion. If 70 million citizens participate, the event will cost over $2 billion.<a href=""#cite_note-14"" title="""">[15]</a></li><li>Law of Group Polarization. One important critique of deliberation comes from Cass R. Sunstein who argues that group deliberation eventually leads to group polarization. Put simply, people do what they believe others do, or what others want them to do.<a href=""#cite_note-15"" title="""">[16]</a></li><li>Problem with mediated (indirect) society-wide deliberation. Archon Fung states how ""public communicative power is, however, necessarily indirect in its political impact.""<a href=""#cite_note-16"" title="""">[17]</a> Such nation-wide, and participatory, deliberation has a weak connection with the process of making public policy; therefore, there is little political relevance.</li><li>American election law hinders Deliberation Day. Chad Flanders states how Deliberation Day fails to consider America's protection of political parties, which cause opinions that are not voiced within the major political parties to be highly excluded. Chad Flanders also states how in order to have effective deliberation, not only citizens, but also the President and representatives in Congress have to deliberate.<a href=""#cite_note-17"" title="""">[18]</a></li></ul><p><a id=""References"" name=""References""></a></p><h2>References</h2><ol class=""references""><li id=""cite_note-0""><a href=""#cite_ref-0"" title="""">↑</a> Bruce Ackerman, James S.

"<p>Crowdsourcing is a new phenomenon in which an organization calls upon both professionals and amateurs on the internet to help solve a problem, design a product, or analyze large amounts of data at a lower cost and often greater quality and speed than through conventional research and development methods.
</p>

<a name=""Purpose"" id=""Purpose""></a><h2> Purpose </h2>
<p>The internet provides an unprecedented medium in which users from disparate backgrounds and geographic locations can meet, interact, and share ideas.  Crowdsourcing is the leveraging and focusing of the largely untapped talent and brain power of well educated amatuers who are interested in a given topic but do not happen to be professionally employed in these fields.  Other tasks that are not highly complex, but difficult for a computer to accomplish, such as describing a photograph, are compatible with crowdsourcing.
</p><p>One of the most important factors of crowdsourcing is the fact that it is an open call for help, allowing any internet user to contribute.  Because of this, organizations are able to draw upon a huge population of users who are able to self-select themselves into addressing the problems they are most fit to solve.  This is accomplished through facilitating users' contributions in a created space that has a framework and basic guidelines while remaining as open as possible in order to receive diverse submissions.  As explained by Beth Simone Noveck, the diverse perspectives users have results in submissions that are more inventive and regularly of higher quality than solutions created by hired research professionals surrounded by like minded people.
</p><p>By providing some kind of incentive, usually payment, many users are often tempted to try to solve these problems, but only those who create substantive results are rewarded.  This creates a structure in which organizations can receive large amounts of manpower at very little cost, while at the same time often receiving vital information on the nature and wishes of their participants.  For corporations, crowdsourcing provides them not only with solutions but also consumer's perspectives on their products, which can then be used to refine their corporation in ways unrelated to the problem at hand.

<a name=""History"" id=""History""></a><h2> History </h2>
<p>Although first coined by Jeff Howe in a 2006 edition of <a href=""http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/14.06/crowds.html?pg=1&topic=crowds&topic_set="" class=""external text"" title=""http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/14.06/crowds.html?pg=1&topic=crowds&topic_set="" rel=""nofollow"">[Wired Magazine</a>], the process had already been implemented by a few online companies.  Some of the first examples come from companies Threadless and iStockPhoto.  On threadless.com, users may submit graphics for tshirts and are selected by the community by clicking ""I'd buy it!"".  The most popular designs are printed and offered for sale, with the winning designer receiving $2000 and $500 as a Threadless gift certificate <a href=""#cite_note-0"" title="""">[1]</a>.  <a href=""http://www.istockphoto.com"" class=""external text"" title=""http://www.istockphoto.com"" rel=""nofollow"">[iStockPhoto</a>] is a similar community of amateur photographers that collectively create a large database of stock photographs.  Any organization looking for royalty-free photographs can buy them at a significantly lower price than hiring a professional photographer.  The size of the site quickly exploded, providing more pictures to choose from than any single stock photographer could provide.  Contributors to the site receive a 20% commission every time their photographs are purchased, and depending on the success of their photographs their commission can rise to 40%<a href=""#cite_note-1"" title="""">[2]</a>.
</p><p>After Howe's article detailing the advantages of crowdsourcing, this production model was then adopted by offline companies, as seen in marketing strategies for Doritos and Chevy automobiles that called on consumers to create commercials for them.  As a result of this program a user created Dorito advertisement was aired during the 2007 Super Bowl <a href=""#cite_note-Brabham-2"" title="""">[3]</a>, reflecting the rapid and highly publicized adoption of crowdsourcing in the business world.
</p>
<a name=""Outcomes_.26_Effects"" id=""Outcomes_.26_Effects""></a><h2> Outcomes & Effects </h2>
<p>Because crowdsourcing is essentially a production model, the outcome is emphasized more than in other deliberative models.  When structured properly, crowdsourcing can create solutions and products that professionals cannot largely due to the size of people contributing.  After aggregating the responses, submissions are of higher quality than what the most intelligent participant could have created, as obseved by James Surowiecki's in his book <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisdom_of_crowds|"" class=""external text"" title=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisdom_of_crowds|"" rel=""nofollow"">The Wisdom of Crowds</a>.
</p><p>Another effect of crowdsourcing is the empowerment contributors experience when they are able to solve a problem or design a successful product.  Exploitation of these users is a source of continuing concern, as mentioned by Jeff Howe in his seminal article on crowdsourcing, but contributors enter these agreements willingly and usually with enthusiasm, as they would not be paid for using their talents in their current jobs and see it as a release of pent up talent they can't use in their normal lives.  Because results are often only known to and capitalized by the organization, however, this is not a perfectly democratic method.
</p>
<a name=""Examples"" id=""Examples""></a><h2> Examples </h2>
<p>InnoCentive:
</p><p>Innocentive is one of the earliest and most developed platforms for crowdsourcing currently on the web.  Hundreds of highly complex engineering, chemistry, medical, and environmental challenges are posted on the website at any given time, most with rewards ranging from $5,000 to $1000000.  Innocentive is designed as an intermediary that connects corporations, non profits, and government to a motivated user base of more than 200,000 so called ""solvers"".  Some users have even quit their day jobs to pursue solving these problems full time<a href=""#cite_note-3"" title="""">[4]</a>.

Wikipedia:
</p><p>Wikipedia is the most successful example of non-profit crowdsourcing.  Beginning in 2001, Wikipedia is a platform in which any online user can contribute to an online encyclopedia.  Despite an absence of any form of compensation, the urge to solidify a collective conscious online has created an exhaustive, fact checked, and free encyclopedia in dozens of languages.  There are currently over 14 million articles posted on Wikipedia, 3 million of them english, all provided free of charge by users <a href=""#cite_note-4"" title="""">[5]</a>.  Superfluous and incorrect information is removed through peer review and expert volunteer moderators.
</p><p>Next Stop Design:
</p><p>A program sponsored by the Federal Transportation Administration and developed by researchers from the University of Utah, Next Stop Design calls upon internet users to design a bus stop in the Sugarhouse neighborhood of Salt Lake City.  The winning designer received a free utah transit authority bus pass for a year.  The winner was decided from 11,000 votes on 260 submissions <a href=""#cite_note-5"" title="""">[6]</a>.
</p><p><a href=""/organizations/citizens"" title=""Citizens"">Citizens</a>
</p><p>Short history of Skuggaþing (Shadow Parliament) and Betri Reykjavík (Better Reykjavík)
</p><p>In the last (2010) municipal elections in Reykjavík, the capital city of Iceland, almost 10% of the voting population took part in the majority talks of two parties via a website called Betri Reykjavik (Better Reykjavik). The history of the website and the software developed for it is recounted in this document.
</p><p>The greatest strength of the system is that it uses the opinions of its users (crowd-sourceing) to evaluate the importance, quality and usefulness of the ideas/issues and also crowd-sources the selection of the best arguments/points for and against those ideas/issues. Thus enabling users to make up their minds about most issues in a very short time.
</p>
<a name=""Analysis_.26_Criticism"" id=""Analysis_.26_Criticism""></a><h2>Analysis & Criticism </h2>
<p>As a deliberative process, crowdsourcing is unique.  It is able to unite large numbers of like minded individuals to work on the same problem, but it causes problems as well as opportunities.  Because of the economic incentive involved in most crowdsourcing, the nature of the deliberation is competitive.  Providing a reward does increase the number of submissions, but this also leads to a lack of communication between users, as they want the prize for themselves.  Organizations that crowdsource are often able to sift through the submissions and often do receive a satisfactory result, but if users were encouraged to actively collaborate among themselves, better results could appear.  This is a difficult thing to accomplish due to the asynchronous nature of the internet, and could slow down the process.  In an <a href=""http://www.wired.com/techbiz/media/news/2007/07/crowd_captain?currentPage=all"" class=""external text"" title=""http://www.wired.com/techbiz/media/news/2007/07/crowd_captain?currentPage=all"" rel=""nofollow"">[interview</a>] Andrea Grover proposes that the impersonal nature of the internet allows for more submissions because users are less aware of judgments that may be made on their submissions and are therefore more likely to contribute.  Introducing direct collaboration to crowdsourcing could end up causing valuable information to be self censored by self conscious users.
</p><p>One of the primary problems of this method as a way to further democracy has been its application.  Because of its business based development, it is still primarily used to benefit individual entrepeneurs.  Although self satisfaction is a facet of what draws internet users to participate in solving problems for other people, the economic incentive is often the driving factor.  As a deliberative process, however, crowdsourcing has potential applications in essentially every idea based field, and its low cost can be used to accomplish more than low overhead, as seen in the previous non profit and governmental examples.  The interactive and empowering facets of crowdsourcing have been observed within the private sector as effectively creating tight knit communities and provide critical insight into consumer's opinions.  If implemented correctly, more governmental and non profit organizations could use crowdsourcing solely for the public interest.  Beth Simone Noveck observes, however, that government has largely not embraced the internet's potential as a participatory forum.  If correctly implemented, government could capitalize on the cheap labor of crowdsourcing to solve problems for the greater good, while at the same time empowering, involving, and connecting citizens to their own government.

"<a name=""Definition"" id=""Definition""></a><h2> Definition </h2>
<p>Conversation Cafes are openly hosted conversations in local coffee shops, but are also widely entertained inside, but not limited to, restaurants, conference rooms, churches, and classrooms. This participatory method was intentionally designed in efforts to gather friends, neighbors, acquaintances, and strangers to exchange something more than ""small talk"" on a regular basis. The agenda is set in hopes to create stimulating conversations among a diverse set of minds who have a common goal to not only express their own preferences, but to further explore, develop, and possibly rehabilitate their own opinions through the engagement with others in their community. <a href=""#cite_note-conversation_cafe-0"" title="""">[1]</a>
</p><p>Conversation Cafes aim to foster a society that actively engages in important social topics, which are newly selected for each gathering, by creating a temporary environment that promotes--through mild facilitation--certain conversational etiquette, including open-mindedness, acceptance, curiosity, discovery, sincerity, and brevity. <a href=""#cite_note-conversation_cafe-0"" title="""">[1]</a> The project addresses the need to escape the crippling dangers of a repressive society, and attempts to increase social intelligence through the construction of social capital, thus generating social engagement. <a href=""#cite_note-participation-1"" title="""">[2]</a> From this practice of the ""Socratic tradition"" of respectful dialogue, these Conversation Cafes aspire to build a more enlightened--and thus wiser--democracy. The minimal, simplistic, and undemanding structure of its agenda allows for this hosted event to seem feasible for anyone and everyone to become a part of the small group, transforming interpersonal communication from trivial topics to conversations that matter. The goal is not to refine answers, pick out flaws, and decide on a list of solutions from a pool of ideas, but rather to listen respectfully, cultivate individual ideas and vocalize them, and suspend judgements about others in the process.
</p>
<a name=""Process"" id=""Process""></a><h2> Process </h2>
<p>The process of Conversation Cafes follows a conventional outline. In its inception, hosts assemble up to 10 people and generally have a topic or theme selected prior to the event. As a part of the introduction, the host explains the Conversation Cafe agreements, which promote respect, suspends judgment, seeks understanding and new insights rather than persuasion, sharing of personal testimonies and honesty. <a href=""#cite_note-conversation_cafe-0"" title="""">[1]</a> Once the conversational maxims are pledged to be adhered to by all participants, the host explains the step-by-step process of what is about to occur in the following 60-90 minutes. Furthermore, a ""Talking Object"" is presented, which permits only the speaker who has the Talking Object in hand to present their views, and is then passed along the circle in a timely manner (individuals are allowed to ""pass"" and not say anything). The Talking Object can be any miscellaneous item. 
</p><p>Once the rules and goals of the event are unanimously understood among all participants, the host should pass out pencils and paper/index cards for people to jot down their thoughts. The conversation begins with introductions and then proceeds into round 1, where each person briefly addresses the topic at hand with no reciprocated feedback from others, using the Talking Object. Then, round 2 takes place as the Talking Object is still in a motion, with each individual further explaining in explicit detail their prior comments and thoughts, or any fresh insights they had arrived at since then. At the end of the facilitated rounds using the Talking Object, the host opens up the floor to free dialogue. At this time, groups participate in open, spirited conversation, and the Talking Object is only implemented to control contention, domination, or to redirect tangent conversations that are far from the topic at hand. To conclude, the last 5-10 minutes before the ending time is devoted to the final round, which reintroduces the Talking Object, as each person takes a moment to reflect and briefly state how their prior ways of thinking had changed, refined, or strengthened. <a href=""#cite_note-participation-1"" title="""">[2]</a> 
</p><p>While Conversation Cafes have this general skeletal outline of communication, there are three, narrowly defined types of conversations that can occur in response to unique circumstances: Cafe Lite (less than 45 minutes), Instant Cafe (spontaneous), and Super Cafe (large events).<a href=""#cite_note-conversation_cafe-0"" title="""">[1]</a>
</p>
<a name=""History"" id=""History""></a><h2> History </h2>
<p>The inception of Conversation Cafes took place in the summer of 2001, in the city of Seattle, Washington. The idea was conceived by author Vicki Robin and her friends, Susan Partnow and Habib Rose. Living with the mantra that more spontaneous, casual public dialogue would better mold the critical minds that make up our democracy all the while simultaneously fostering friendly relations, each of the three Seattle women sat in a different cafe every week and began conversations with neighboring customers on important matters. Officially, on September 10, 2001, what began as a simple fostering of coffee house meetings for casual yet stimulating discussions on current issues amongst customers continued on into what is now recognized as Conversation Cafes. 
</p><p>From that moment in history, this method of participatory deliberation spread throughout the city of Seattle and ultimately caught on in seventy cities in the U.S., Canada, and Europe. New Road Map Foundation funded the project from its primordial stages, with the Foundation for Global Community and Bob and Jacquelyn Pogue's foundation contributing large sums as well. <a href=""#cite_note-conversation_cafe-0"" title="""">[1]</a>
</p><p>The invention of ""Conversation Week"" premiered soon after, where all Conversation Cafes across the world pondered over the same topic for one week each year. Through this global communication and exchange of ideas, a sense of patriotic unity emerged. Co-founders Vicki and Susan transferred the project to Bob and Jacquelyn Pogue, who are now the head stewards of the online Conversation Cafe website. <a href=""#cite_note-conversation_cafe-0"" title="""">[1]</a>
</p>
<a name=""Case_Studies"" id=""Case_Studies""></a><h2> Case Studies </h2>
<p>Community X-Change:
</p><p>From 2005 to 2006, this case study that took place in the United Kingdom, analyzed the beginnings of a series of workshops where members of the public, scientists, and policy makers came together to discuss relevant issues on science. <a href=""#cite_note-participation-1"" title="""">[2]</a> This new method for dialogue provided an isolated area of time and space in which these individuals could converse about ideas for possible actions concerning the policy of climate change. 
</p><p>Participants were carefully selected in order to ensure a diverse range of views, and they met on a regular basis to talk about the climate change with regards to other science and technology issues. A rigor structure was provided to guide the discussions of the group. Individuals of the study attended an interactive video report at the 2006 BA Festival of Science in Norwich. <a href=""#cite_note-participation-1"" title="""">[2]</a>
</p><p>As for the results of the study, a majority of the members had genuinely expected that something was going to be produced from their efficient process of discourse, and that the ideas generated would be presented to decision-makers. By creating a safe, constructive space for scientists and citizens to communicate, the two compartmentalized groups found a common language to relate with. More specifically, scientists overcame their fears of a two-way engagement with the public individuals. <a href=""#cite_note-participation-1"" title="""">[2]</a>
</p>
<a name=""Evaluation"" id=""Evaluation""></a><h2> Evaluation </h2>
<p>The minimal cost and necessities to host a Conversation Cafe makes it an appealing and inviting method of deliberation since all that is needed is an open, public space and a willing individual to host the event. <a href=""#cite_note-2"" title="""">[3]</a>
Other strengths regard its informality, flexibility, and its encouragement to actively listen, learn, and share different views. Weaknesses include its lack of structure and rigor, and that the activity does not lead to any particular goal except accomplishing the social deed of conversation and dialogue. <a href=""#cite_note-3"" title="""">[4]</a>
</p><p>In terms of its evaluation as a deliberative process, the overall analytic process of deliberation is moderately to highly successful. The introduction phase allows the time and encourages individuals to discuss personal and emotional experiences, especially those attending with not much prior legal background information regarding the topics at hand. With the opening time of silence to digest the announced topic, participants are encouraged to reflect on their own values before the speaking portion of the event begins. Beyond that, the use of the Talking Object not only regulates equal distribution of speaking time, but it also allows for those who are listening to reflect on the communicated values they hear as well as their own, as they wait for their turn to speak. Since the main goal of Conversation Cafes is to produce a free flow of ideas, suspending own opinions to bring alternative views that are often eclipsed from our own view to light, this method ideally works to generate a range of different ideas and possibilities. Furthermore, as the last stage of the method is a time where each individual reflects and has one minute to summarize their new insights, the development of refined judgments in light of what was said is the ultimate if not only goal of this deliberative method. 
</p><p>In terms of the overall social process of deliberation, it is also fairly successful. To begin, the implementation of a Talking Object strictly ensures a balanced discussion in which no one person is denied the opportunity to speak. Each turn is evenly distributed by time. The middle round of open discussion allows for members to respond to other comments, as well as ask clarifying questions, listening carefully to each voice even in disagreement since there is no pressure to reach a consensus. The thoroughly constructed skeletal outline of the conversation leaves no room for disrespectful behaviors, but if any were to be exchanged, the presence of a host would regulate the matter. Therefore, the overall social process set in these coffee houses are cooperative and considerate in regards to each member of the small group.

"<p><a id=""Definition"" name=""Definition""></a></p><h1>Definition</h1><p>Robert’s Rules of Order is book on parliamentary procedure. The title provides a detailed study of parliamentary procedure and how it is practiced in various settings. Currently in its 10th edition, the book has enjoyed widespread success and is used by 85% of all organizations in the United States.</p><p><a id=""Problems_and_Purpose"" name=""Problems_and_Purpose""></a></p><h1>Problems and Purpose</h1><p>Robert's Rules or Order is intended to control and facilitate meeting situations in an efficient manner that allows for debate, discussion, and deliberation. Robert's Rules are organized around the idea of a presented motion. All motions have a precedence which means that they can only be used when they have a higher precedence than all other active motions. The most basic of all motions is called the Main Motion. Main Motions are policy that the body would like to discuss and cover with debate. For example, if a member of the body wishes to use funds to buy something for the organization, he could ask for recognition by the chairman and state ""I move that we spend X amount of money to purchase Y for our organization"". For almost all motions, recognition by the residing chairperson is required before actually making the motion. Some motions, including Main Motions, must be seconded by another member of the body. Seconding does not mean that the the person who seconded agrees with the motion but rather that he or she would like to hear debate on the motion. The idea that seconding does not signify agreeing shows that Robert's Rules are intended to create deliberation. The idea is to discuss each topic and vote based on the discussions heard from all participating members. There are some drawbacks to the debate system. Debates are often timed which, while keeping debaters concise and allowing for more speakers, could potentially limit the information presented in each debate. Also, similar to other methods of parliamentary procedure, debate is intended to move in a way that allows for everyone to speak if they so desire and to alternate from pro to con or vise versa. This often stifles chances for direct rebuttal as the next speaker is likely not to have been the previous debater, that is if another member gives a state that you would like to rebut, but you have just spoken, you will likely not be able to give your rebuttal unless there are no other speakers.</p><p>There are other methods of discussion used in Robert's Rules. One of the most notable is the ability to send any motion to a committee. Committee parameters are set out by the chairperson, but they can range from simply exploring the subject in a more personal setting, bringing in and listening to outside presenters, completing research, to actually reaching a decision on the motion.</p><p>A notable feature of Robert's Rules is the Chairperson. The Chairperson has the purpose of keeping order in the assembly. The chairperson must often remain partial and does not usually have a chance to speak and is even less likely to have the ability to vote (a chairperson may vote if it is done by secret ballot or if his or her vote does not affect the outcome). However, the chairperson keeps the meeting on track and ensures that respect is paid to all members.</p><p><a id=""History"" name=""History""></a></p><h1>History</h1><p>The first edition of Robert’s Rule of Order appeared in 1876. The author Henry Martyn Robert (1837-1923) was Brigadier General in the U.S. Army whose original motivation for the title came in 1863 after being asked to preside over a church meeting in San Francisco. Despite having little experience in parliamentary procedure, Robert accepted the offer and was embarrassed and humbled by his futile effort to control the passions and flow of the meeting. Resolving to learn more about his failure, Robert was determined to educate himself on the process of parliamentary procedure, beginning what would become a 14 years of study on the subject. His main source of correct procedures came from the U.S. House of Representatives, a system based loosely off the British House of Commons. This in turn led to a study of the writings of Thomas Jefferson who was largely responsible for the version of early parliamentary procedure practiced in the U.S. at the federal level of government. Robert supplemented this study with real world experience gained by attending numerous and varying types of meetings as his continued army service found him stationed all over the country throughout his study. His attendance at these meetings led him to realize that meetings were practiced with great variance throughout the nation and often had limited success. His solution was to design a manual to clarify proceedings in order to have a common source available to all that would assist in the organization and effectiveness of meetings. In February of 1876 the first phase of his study conclude with the publication of the Pocket Manual of Rules of Order for Deliberative Assemblies. The cover of the book simply read Robert’s Rules of Order, a title to which the work would henceforth be known. The book sold through its initial print and a second printing was completed in July the same year. A third edition was published in 1893 and a revised edition appeared in 1915. The revised fourth edition would also mark the last edition the Robert would publish himself. Upon Robert’s death in 1923, a trust headed by his family was set up to handle all future editions of the title. Two more editions closely tied to the original work would be published before the book was rewritten for the 7th edition. Robert’s Rules of Order Newly Revised was released in 1970 and represented a new approach by the Robert’s family trust. Whereas all prior editions assumed a familiarity with parliamentary procedure, the seventh edition was designed to have greater appeal to the general public. The resulting title was far more explanatory than the previous editions, allowing the layman to understand the rational for the proceedings as well as the procedures. Subsequent editions have stuck with this model and having only been slightly modified to reflect technological changes and their effects on meetings.</p><p><a id=""Participant_Selection"" name=""Participant_Selection""></a></p><h1>Participant Selection</h1><p>Anyone can use Robert's Rules of Order and selection depends upon the assembly. It is used in many settings where any and all people are welcome to join the debate, such as town hall meetings, booster clubs, etc. But can also be used in larger scale government settings. In some cases, members may need to be elected as representatives, at other times people will be able to represent them selves. Outside presenters are allowed within the rules, so even representative forums can still have debate from people other than members.</p><p><a id=""Use_of_the_Rules"" name=""Use_of_the_Rules""></a></p><h2>Use of the Rules</h2><p>While oftentimes any person can become involved in some way with an organization that uses Robert's Rules, they might often find that the rules vary. For example, Robert's Rules is now in its tenth edition, but the other editions are still used by some. Rules can be permanently changed to suit the needs of the organization, which while useful for personalizing the rules also leads to some inconsistencies. However, the rules does have a uniformity that is very beneficial to the system. Some people new to an organization may feel flustered by the rather extensive rules, but if they have a basic knowledge it is not too difficult to catch on to how each organization uses the rules even if they are altered. The issue still arises with learning the rules. They are extensive, involved, and complicated. So complicated in fact that they are even used in a competitive arena. The National FFA Organization and other groups actually creates teams that study the rules and preform mock sessions in front of a panel of judges while trying their best to be as accurate and efficient with the rules as possible. And while competition may serve as a motivator for learning the rules, it also hi-lights an important problem; the rules are not immediately user-friendly. Anyone new to using Robert's Rules of Order will be bombarded with pages and pages of dull writing that is often discouraging. The rules are intricate and without a firm grasp of them, it is easy to miss out on your chance to fully involve yourself in discussion. So, after tackling the daunting task of actually learning and memorizing all of the rules, any person should be able to join any assembly and have at least a stable enough grasp on the procedure to participate no matter the changes.</p><p><a id=""Deliberation_and_Decisions"" name=""Deliberation_and_Decisions""></a></p><h1>Deliberation and Decisions</h1><p>Robert's Rules of Order intends to create deliberative discussion. There has even been a revised edition released aimed specifically at deliberative assemblies. Robert's Rules operates under the idea of majority rule while still acknowledging and respecting minority opinion. The system of debate allows for this by ensuring equal speaking opportunities from all sides. This in turn creates a solid information base as each member is given the same time to present his or her opinion. Also, the rules allow for outside presenters which can add even more opinions that are not immediately present in the assembly. The debate allows for all sides to present their key values while listening to others'. It is possible that debaters will try to discredit the other speaker's or prove them incorrect, which could lead to a reduction in deliberativeness. However, solutions have been provided. The motions could be sent to committee which allows for more open discussion that is more likely to lead to compromise and decision-making as the participants are not restricted as much by rules for debate. Also, the rules include opportunities to leave a motion on the table in order to consider it later and for taking short recesses which both allow time for discussion that is, again, not marred by the rules of debate. Respect is ensured by the chairperson who presides over the meetings and it is he or she who also guarantees the equal speaking opportunities. Decisions, when referring to main motions, are decided by a majority vote provided that the assembly is at quorum. Votes that result in a tie fail. Very little can be done while following Robert's Rules without the consent of the assembly. This helps ensure that, while there is a presiding officer, that control is not given to one person. The chairperson can make exclusive decisions only for calling the orders of the day (reading the agenda) or questions of privilege (when a member asks the chair for permission to perform a personal task such as going to the restroom or opening a window because the room is too hot). Other than that, every decision, even the decided whether or not to vote, is voted upon.</p><p>Further deliberative action can be seen in motions that allow the assembly to reconsider a motion that has failed or passed. Any motion can be called upon again and, assembly permitting, be reconsidered once again. This reopens debate, allowing for discussion and will eventually lead to another vote which could change the outcome of the previous decision. This certifies more discussion which could lead to a better, more informed solution.</p><p><a id=""Impact"" name=""Impact""></a></p><h1>Impact</h1><p>The effect of Robert’s Rules of Order is just as present today as it was nearly 135 years ago when it was first published. Henry Robert’s work continues to have an impact because it addresses a major but often missing element necessary for a successful organization; a set of agreed upon rules designed to navigate difficult decisions and devised to limit the effects of emotions. This has resulted in the parliamentary procedures presented by the book being adopted by 85% all organizations in United States. Most organizations adopt the book outright as the cornerstone of their proceedings. In the event of a disagreement or other conflict the title is treated as an authority unto itself. The presence of Robert’s Rules can be found in board meetings, city and county councils, student governments, school boards, P.T.A. meetings, homeowner associations, etc. The soundness of its procedures has been affirmed by courts with numerous jurisdictions findings that all organizations are subjects to the rules and principles of parliamentary standards. Organizations that fail to follow the rules after adoption have been the subjects of lawsuits and the recipients of embarrassment. Robert’s Rules of Order has even had an impact on the House of Representatives, the original source for many of the procedures. In 1994, after Democrats lost their legislative majority in the House, Rep. Barney Frank (D) was tasked with studying Robert’s book in order to discover methods the minority party could employ in order to remain relevant. When the Democrats regained the House in 2006, Frank returned to the book in order to devise a strategy to enhance their new majority status.</p><p><a id=""Outlook"" name=""Outlook""></a></p><h1>Outlook</h1><p>At 704 pages in its current edition, Robert’s Rules of Order is only likely to grow. As technology evolves, presenting new ways for people to meet and discuss issues at hand Robert’s Rules will be necessary to determine the proper procedures under circumstances far different from the author’s original outlook. The 10th edition demonstrates this adapt-ability by weighing in on video conferencing and meetings through email. The former is okay so long as everyone can both hear and speak in real time while the latter is not because it lacks this function. As it continues to evolve, it is certain that Robert's Rules of Order will continue to strive for a comprehensive and efficient form of deliberation. Currently, it uses a system of turn-based debate with options for further discussion to allow for opinions and views from all sides to be expressed equally. Though complicated for beginners and intricate in application, a thorough understanding of the rules allows for participation in nearly every organization that uses it even with differing editions and more personalized rules. Robert's Rules of Order do just as their namesake implies; they give order to discussion with the intent of furthering deliberation.</p><p><a id=""References"" name=""References""></a></p><h1>References</h1><p>Roberts Rules of Order, 10th Edition, Wikipedia.org, NY Times.com, “On that Point,” 5/20/07, Jimslaughter.com, Robertsrules.org, <a href=""http://www.robertsrules.com"">www.robertsrules.com</a> Robert, Henry.

"<p>Washington State uses the initiative process which gives direct power to the voters to enact new laws or change existing ones effectively allowing the electorate to place legislation on the ballot so long as they meet certain criteria. By collecting a certain number of signatures an initiative can be placed on the ballot. 
</p><p>Citizens of Washington can use the initiative process to enact two separate types of initiatives as well as two separate type of referenda:
</p><p>•	Initiatives to the People – to directly enact a new state law
</p><p>•	Initiatives to the Legislature – indirectly enact a new state law
</p><p>•	Referendum Measures – Laws recently passed by the legislature and put to a vote by the people
</p><p>•	Referendum Bills – Laws referred to the voters by the legislature
</p>

<a name=""Purpose"" id=""Purpose""></a><h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>The Purpose of the Washington State Initiative process is to empower citizens to take an active role proposing, amending, or repealing new legislation for consideration by Washington voters.
</p>
<a name=""Types_of_Initiatives_and_Referenda"" id=""Types_of_Initiatives_and_Referenda""></a><h2>Types of Initiatives and Referenda</h2>
<p>Initiatives to the People: When certified as having enough signatures this type of initiative is submitted to a vote at the next state general election and will appear on the ballot.
</p><p>Initiatives to the Legislature: When certified as having enough signatures this type of initiative is submitted to the Legislature at its regular session each January. After being submitted to the Legislature, the Legislature can take one of three options:
</p><p>•	The Legislature can adopt the initiative as it has been proposed by the public and in this case it becomes law without it a vote by the people
</p><p>•	The Legislature can reject the proposed initiative or refuse to act on it and in this case the initiative must be placed on the ballot for the state’s next general election
</p><p>•	The Legislature can approve an amended version of the proposed initiative and this this case both the amended and the original versions of the bill will appear on the state’s next general election ballot.
</p><p>Referenda are designed to either approve or reject laws that have been either enacted or proposed by the Washington State Legislature. Laws that are exempted from the power of referendum include emergency laws. Emergency Laws are defined as those that are necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health or safety, and the support of state government and its existing institution.
</p><p>Referendum Measures: Are laws that have recently been passed by the Legislature and are placed on the general ballot due to petitions being signed by voters.
</p><p>Referendum Bills: Are laws originally proposed by the Legislature which are then are referred to the electorate by the legislature.   
</p>
<a name=""History"" id=""History""></a><h2>History</h2>
<p>Washington State official adopted the initiative and referendum process and added it to the state constitution in 1912. In the State of Washington the initiative and representative process was originally proposed by L.E Reeder of Ollalla and passed by a vote of 63 to 12 in the lower house, but failed in the state senate. In 1911 the both houses of the legislature passed, but did not allow voters to initiate state constitutional amendments. Voters then ratified the Initiative and Referendum Bill in 1912.
</p><p>Washington State Voters immediately put to use their new powers and circulated petitions to put seven initiatives on the 1914 ballot, but succeeded in getting only five of those initiatives on the ballot in 1914 with only one being approved which was a measure to abolish private employment agencies. The intent of this law was to stop exploitation of unemployed workers, such as lumberjacks by these private employment agencies.
</p><p>A statewide prohibition initiative was also enacted in 1914 much to the dislike of liquor interests who originally opposed the Initiative and Referendum amendment to the state constitution. The following year ant-initiative forces within the legislature passed a bill that would have made it virtually impossible to place an initiative on the ballot. In response Washington voters used the power of the referendum to block this bill from going into effect until voters could eventually vote it down in the 1916 election by a three to one margin.
</p><p>In response to voters efforts to exercise their right to the Referendum the legislature soon discovered that they could bypass the referendum process by attaching an “emergency clause” to a bill and making it invulnerable to referendum petitions. In 1929 the state Supreme Court ruled the practice of attaching emergency clauses to bills with the intention of bypassing referendum petitions in the absence of a true emergency. 
</p><p>An initiative approving the creation of locally controlled and publically owned electric utility districts was approved in the 1930’s and in 1968 Washington voters approved an initiative requiring drivers stopped by police officers to submit to breathalyzer tests.

<a name=""Filing_Procedures"" id=""Filing_Procedures""></a><h2>Filing Procedures</h2>
<p>For an initiative, in the state of Washington, any registered voter who is acting as an individual or for an organization, has the right can propose legislation to create a new state law or amend or amend or appeal existing statutes.
</p><p>To appear on the ballot, the sponsor of the initiative must file a printed or typed copy of the complete text of the proposed initiative with the office of the Secretary of State along with a ($5.00) filling fee as well as a sworn affidavit that the sponsor of the initiative is a legal voter in the state of Washington which all become a matter of public record.
</p><p>Initiatives to the People must be filed within ten months prior to the next state general election and the signature sheets must be filed no less than four months prior to the next general election.
</p><p>Initiatives to the Legislature must be filed ten months prior to the next regular session of the Legislature and the signature sheets must be filed no less than ten days prior to the next regular session of the Legislature. 
</p><p>Both types of initiative measures require a minimum number of signatures equal to eight percent of the number of votes cast for the office of Governor in the last regular gubernatorial election.
</p><p>For a referendum the legislature may require that a law must be submitted for voter approval. 
</p><p>Or
</p><p>Any registered voter who is acting as an individual or for an organization may demand, through a petition, that a law that has been passed by the legislature be put to a vote in the general election before it goes into effect except in the case of emergency legislation. 
</p><p>Both types of referendum measures require a minimum number of signatures equal to four percent of the number of votes cast for the office of Governor in the last regular gubernatorial election.
</p><p>
</p>
<a name=""Analysis_and_Criticism"" id=""Analysis_and_Criticism""></a><h2>Analysis and Criticism</h2>
<p>Overall the initiative process allows constituents to actively engage with their legislators and respond voice what they believe are essential needs for the community. The referendum process also provides a line of communication that allows the Washington electorate to respond and block legislation that they believe to be detrimental or undesirable.  
</p><p>The Initiative and Referendum process has received criticism that it undermines representative democracy and places too much power in the hands of the electorate who have often been conserved fickle or lacking in a deep understanding of the issues that surround various initiatives and referenda. Critics believe that it would be better to allow legislators who they perceive to have a deeper understanding of issues and that the public interest would be better served by legislatures. 
</p><p>Criticism has also reach legislators as they have been said to use the “emergency clause” too freely when passing through touchy bill. The power struggle continues as the electorate continues to spar with legislators over who should have more authority in passing legislation. The tug of war continues as pro-initiative groups and individuals such as Tim Eyman work to limit the decision making power of legislators with his recent I-1053 requiring a super majority vote in both houses or a referendum by the electorate to raise taxes. Initiatives such as this place more of a burden on the electorate to effectively raise taxes. Which as the cost continues to rise to effectively sponsor new initiatives make it more difficult for “mom and pop” sponsors to sponsor new initiatives which could widen the gap of accessible government and detract from the original purpose of the initiative process which is, to empower citizens to take an active role proposing new legislation for the ballot, but which becomes increasingly more difficult as the cost of running a successful initiative campaign rises.
</p><p>
Further criticism of the initiative process says that the initiative and referenda system in the state of Washington has trended increasing toward being big business. While the official filing fee for a new initiative is only five dollars the cost of creating awareness and gathering signatures for initiatives and referenda has become very expensive since Washington initially adopted I&R legislation in 1912. The large numbers of signatures that are required to get an initiative on the ballot are extremely high and have turned initiative campaigning into and industry for Individuals such as Tim Eyman. As the cost of acquiring the approx. 240 thousand signatures required (8% of the total votes for governor in 2008) continue to rise as companies emerge that charge per name for gathering signatures (signature gathers are not required to be Washington State voters).

"<a name="""" id=""""></a><h1>Definition:</h1>
<p>	Kgotla meetings were large tribal assemblies that were used by Tswana chiefs to discuss important issues, policies and legislation with their subjects. Boris Weber, writing for the World Bank's anti-corruption blog, described the kgotla assembly as ""a democratic process in which the village chief would consult with local villagers who have the right to express their views and concerns.""<a href=""#cite_note-0"" title="""">[1]</a> He was of course referring to present day kgotla meetings, which although important to Botswanan political life, are much smaller than the kind of traditional tribal assemblies which occurred during that nation's earlier years. Although their names and procedures varied somewhat depending on the importance of the issue being discussed as well as the nature of the issue itself, meetings of this sort all shared the same basic structure. The general goal of the system was to attain consensus on whatever issue or potential law the assembly happened to be discussing. The system also served to notify chiefs of their proposal's popularity (or lack thereof.) In this respect it was both a consultative and an indirectly participatory practice. Note that the word kgotla actually refers to the building or area in which the assembly takes place but in the literature is commonly used to denote the assemblies that commonly met there as well.
</p>
<a name="""" id=""""></a><h1>Process:</h1>
<p>	Although the size and scope of the tribal assemblies varied depending on the type of meeting as well as its subject, they all had the same basic format. The chief, his family, and his advisers sat in front of the assembly which would be seated around them in a semi-circle. Other than that there was no set seating arrangement. Once seated, the chief would tell those in attendance his purpose for calling them all together. He would then relinquish the floor to his advisers and trusted headmen (elite political figures) who were charged with opening the debate. After the administrative elites had stated their own positions, the rest of the body was invited to ask questions and discuss the issue. Speakers were given unlimited time to deliver thoughts, criticisms, and to ask questions to every participant including government officials. If more than one participant wished to speak, precedence was given to the most aged and socially prominent one among or between them.
</p><p>	When the discussion died out, senior headmen and other political elites would again elucidate upon their own opinions. After hearing his officials' perspectives, the chief would announce his own decision on whatever issue they had been considering to the entire assembly, and thus conclude the meeting. <a href=""#cite_note-name-1"" title="""">[2]</a>
</p>
<a name="""" id=""""></a><h1>History:</h1>
<p>	The Tswana had begun to develop the kgotla tradition during the early 1800s and by the time British Empire had incorporated the nation under their imperialist wing as the Bechuanaland Protectorate in 1885, the Tswana people had already developed a unique political culture centered around public consultation.<a href=""#cite_note-2"" title="""">[3]</a>   The British government, in concurrence with its indirect governance strategy, encouraged this propensity through legislation which put into law what many chiefs had already begun to do, that is, bring all potential laws before a public assembly so as to benefit from their consult. So from then on, after devising legislation together with his advisers, the chief was expected to call a tribal assembly and to put whatever it was that he had produced before them for consideration. If the men assembled liked the proposal, the chief would surely implement it. If they did not like it however, he would more often than not either scrap his plans or modify them to make them more agreeable to his subjects, though he was not legally bound to do so. This was perhaps due to the Tswana's unique political culture, which among other things, emphasized that the ""Chief is Chief by grace of his tribe,"" a sentiment which certainly does not encourage unilateral domestic policy implementation. In the early days the kgotla acted effectively as a means of indirect participation in Tswanan government and  to ensure “competent leadership” <a href=""#cite_note-3"" title="""">[4]</a>
</p><p>	The British had chosen to leave the traditional government in place partly because they were so effective at keeping things running smoothly. The stability had come at a steep price though. While their support did help the Chiefs maintain political stability in the region it inadvertently degraded the already somewhat specious quality of the Tswana’s only democratic institution. Chiefs no longer ruled ""by the grace of the people,"" rather they served the people at the behest of the British empire. In other words, the popular constraints (civil unrest, disobedience, and general noncooperation) that had kept their tribal sovereigns in line were neutered by foreign money and military support. <a href=""#cite_note-4"" title="""">[5]</a> Still the tribes managed to survive and eventually became the Independent Republic of Botswana in 1966. With the advent of representative democracy came the central bureaucracy which greatly diminished the powers of the old tribal chiefs. Today, kgotla meetings are still held but due to several factors (including an across the board decline in civic participation) are sparsely attended. <a href=""#cite_note-5"" title="""">[6]</a>
</p>
<a name="""" id=""""></a><h1>Case Studies:</h1>
<p>N/A
</p>
<a name="""" id=""""></a><h1>Evaluation:</h1>
<p>	Theoretically, these meetings could have been extremely deliberative. Participants were technically permitted to speak their minds to the open assembly and respond to the questions and to the comments of others without restriction. They were given complete and unadulterated access to policy makers whom they could bombard with questions and complaints. Since the ruling elites' goal was to convince the people to support the official policy, they would endeavor to respond to criticisms and answer any questions that were presented to them. Ideally, this “back-and-forth” between both sides would continue until the chief felt that the matter was settled and announced his decision, taking into account the assembly's values and their overall assessment of the law. In some ways these meetings resembled a deliberative public meeting, in theory at least. In practice however, it is unlikely they were very deliberative.
</p><p>	Even though all men could sit in the kgotla and in some cases were actually forced to attend the event, they were not all able to participate. According to E. H. Ashton, men in subordinate positions would ""scarcely have the right, and seldom the temerity, to speak"" during the proceedings and that even if they managed to pluck up the courage and attempted to discuss the issue with the assembly ""no one would pay much attention to what they said.” <a href=""#cite_note-6"" title="""">[7]</a> Deliberative public meetings make sure that all participants have the opportunity to speak. This clearly was not the case in the chief’s kgotla during such assemblies. 
</p><p>Another potentially anti-deliberative element of the actual meetings was the fact that although the chief did not state his official position, it was commonly known that he and his advisers had spent a lot of time discussing the issue in private and that therefore the positions of those advisors (which were included in the opening discussions) were probably shared by the chief as well. As a result many dissenters were kept quiet by the awareness that if they raised objections against the ideas of the advisers they could also be attacking the plans of the chief himself.<a href=""#cite_note-7"" title="""">[8]</a> So not only were minorities and other ""undesirables"" kept out of the discussion, but older, more prominent men were also discouraged from contributing to the assembly if their opinions went against what was assumed to be the status quo. In order for a public meeting to be deliberative it must allow participants to discuss different solutions and weigh them against others. Indirectly silencing dissent in such a manner would obviously impede this kind of analysis. In fact, there is evidence that suggests the meetings were used primarily by the chief to convince his subjects to go along with his proposals, rather than to deliberate on the problem his proposal was supposed to solve. <a href=""#cite_note-8"" title="""">[9]</a>
</p><p>	Even if the chief happened to be interested in considering the faults of his own favored proposal along with the strengths of alternative solutions, he would still have to be present at the actual event, which from a deliberative stand point was not a good place for him to be. In fact, his presence, while theoretically helping to facilitate an informative discussion between ruler and subject, might have actually impeded the body’s deliberation. In Tswana culture, the chief was a highly respected figure among the people. Thus many men may have chosen to stay quiet in spite of their objections to the Chief’s proposals. Deliberative public meetings require that officials are able to hear the “authentic” and “unfiltered” opinions of the public.<a href=""#cite_note-9"" title="""">[10]</a> However, because of the people’s aforementioned veneration of their chiefs, it is unlikely (except in cases where the proposal and/or the chief himself was unpopular) that they would actually voice disagreement with any proposals that seemed contrary to his will. Though it is important to remember that there were cases in which the assembly aggressively resisted the proposals of their ruler. For instance, in 1940s, an unpopular chief was dethroned by an angry throng of kgotla participants after he tried to keep the position from his nephew (the rightful heir) after ruling in his place for a while during the boy's youth. <a href=""#cite_note-10"" title="""">[11]</a> 
</p><p>	It is also important to note that all of the discussion that occurred during this event occurred before the entire assembly. So even if a man was of the dominant tribal association and of a high status, his anxiety over addressing such a large group may have kept him from speaking his mind. The historical record makes no mention of the assembly having any special system for encouraging reluctant speakers to stand before the crowd. They did not split up into smaller groups as is necessary for deliberative public meetings.
</p><p>	At the end of the assembly the chief was expected to announce his decision in light of the assembly's discussions. He took neither poll nor vote (although he could request that they arrange themselves by ward so he could discern each area’s stance on whatever they had been discussing.<a href=""#cite_note-11"" title="""">[12]</a>) In theory, the chief would choose the position with the most support of his people and modify proposals that were not as popular. Even though he was under no legal obligation to obey the will of his subjects, the chief knew that he could not govern without the cooperation of his people. Thus, in the early days at least, these meetings had some deliberative elements as the chief was forced to incorporate the values of his subjects into his decrees as well as consider other ways of solving any problems he had wished to solve with his original proposal.
</p><p>	One core issue that would have flat out prevented the assemblies from being truly deliberative public meetings was their complete exclusion of women. Cultural concerns aside, women were still part of their society (ie “the public”) and since the goal of any deliberative public meeting is to facilitate a dialogue between public officials and citizens <a href=""#cite_note-12"" title="""">[13]</a>, their absence would obviously harm the process’s deliberative potential, if not kill it outright. Public meetings that do not allow a significant proportion of the public to participate cannot be very deliberative, no matter how informative and lively their discussions are.

"<p><a id=""Definition"" name=""Definition""></a></p><h1>Definition</h1><p>Study circles -- also called Dialogue-to-Change programs, Dialogue-to-Action, or Dialogue Circles -- emphasize small group deliberation by providing opportunities for members of a community to meet face-to-face and discuss a particular set of issues that are important to them. They can be used by neighborhoods, school districts, counties and cities, as well as other organizations and larger regions. These programs meet regularly over a certain period of time, which can last from weeks to months, to engage and further refine a public issue. The final product of these discussions is to actively brainstorm a variety of solutions and assess the strengths and weaknesses of those solutions in a final large group discussion. Meetings are guided by a neutral facilitator that refrains from imposing his or her opinions or expertise on the group. Study circles aim to incorporate the diverse backgrounds of the community’s constituents and encourage participants to respectfully consider the views and values of fellow members. They also seek to foster social networks between people and uncover new and thoughtful methods of addressing public concerns.<a href=""#cite_note-0"" title="""">[1]</a></p><p><a id=""Process"" name=""Process""></a></p><h1>Process</h1><p><a id=""Organizing_Study_Circles"" name=""Organizing_Study_Circles""></a></p><h3>Organizing Study Circles</h3><p>An initial working group meets to discuss its goals for the study circle program. The group then creates a team of coordinators and delegates specific duties and responsibilities as needed. The team chooses an issue or problem currently faced by the community, which will become the main topic for the study circle discussions. Discussion guides and materials are made as necessary. Coordinators decide the geographic region subject to recruitment of participants. They also select and train facilitators for the study circles. A written plan is composed, which details the structure, schedule, and location of the study circle sessions. Budgeting and fundraising preparations are also made at this time. Sometimes, outside resources are consulted or requested.<a href=""#cite_note-1"" title="""">[2]</a></p><p><a id=""General_Structure_of_Program"" name=""General_Structure_of_Program""></a></p><h3>General Structure of Program</h3><p>Each program begins with a ‘kickoff’ session in which people can participate in ice-breaking activities and get acquainted with each other. During this time, the goals and purposes, as well as the structure and schedule, of the study circles are introduced and described in some detail. The first few sessions allow for people to discuss their values in light of the issue and share any personal experiences. This is done in small groups. The next few meetings, also done in small groups, are designed to examine key arguments surrounding the issue. These arguments, for example, can be for or against a policy change or simply highlight the concerns that participants may have concerning the issue. The last few meetings allow for small groups to brainstorm potential solutions that take into consideration the views, values, and concerns discussed in previous meetings. Afterwards, all of the small groups reconvene in a final large group discussion that narrows the list of ideas into several proposed solutions for the community.<a href=""#cite_note-2"" title="""">[3]</a></p><p><a id=""History"" name=""History""></a></p><h1>History</h1><p>In 1912, the concept of modern day study circles emerged in Sweden after the first study association, ABF, was established. Study associations were created to address issues related to popular movements, such as the temperance and Free Church movements, or other community concerns, such as farmers’ and white-collar workers’ rights. The main purpose of study circles in Sweden is to increase citizen participation and boost social solidarity.<a href=""#cite_note-3"" title="""">[4]</a></p><p>In 1989, the Paul J. Aicher Foundation (formerly known as the Topsfield Foundation), a U.S. nonprofit organization that advances deliberative democracy, established the Study Circles Resource Center (SCRC) to promote the use of dialogue-to-change programs in the U.S. Later, the SCRC would become the organization known as Everyday-Democracy. Everyday-Democracy has published numerous “How-To” guides that people can reference to create their own study circle programs. They also publish news of previous and current examples of study circles used in U.S. neighborhoods and communities. Today, many people use the study circle model offered by the SCRC.<a href=""#cite_note-4"" title="""">[5]</a></p><p>Today, Australia has considered implementing study circles in local areas. The concept was introduced in the 1980s and received growing interest in the late 1990s. The organization Adult Learning Australia (ALA) coined the term “Learning Circles Australia” and has published and circulated various pamphlets encouraging the use of study circles. ALA has also suggested that study circles be used to discuss topics such as land-care issues and Aboriginal reconciliation.<a href=""#cite_note-5"" title="""">[6]</a></p><p><a id=""Case_Studies"" name=""Case_Studies""></a></p><h1>Case Studies</h1><p><a id=""KCK_Study_Circles"" name=""KCK_Study_Circles""></a></p><h3>KCK Study Circles</h3><p>The Kansas City, Kansas (KCK) school district has been confronted with a number of issues, including low parent involvement and student test scores well below the national average. Also, many immigrant families, having increased recently, often found it difficult to transition both academically and culturally to the school systems in Kansas City. The northeastern side of the city particularly faced obstacles such as low income and high unemployment rates, which translated into minimal parent involvement in public schools.</p><p>In 1999, Brandi Fisher, program director for KCK Study Circles, and her colleagues adopted the methodology provided by the SCRC. They printed flyers and made announcements for the program, inviting parents to participate by sharing their views and values. Fisher also reached out to neighborhood organizations and churches to help support KCK school reform. In order to attract more participants, the study circle was held at community centers and churches to help parents who found it uncomfortable to visit their child’s school. School administrators and city council members were excluded for the first few sessions to prevent parents from feeling intimidated. The main goals of the KCK Study Circles were to educate parents on ways that they could help their children succeed but also to allow parents to make their own goals, judgments, and agenda regarding school reform.</p><p>The structure of the KCK Study Circles included three sessions of small group discussion with each group consisting of between eight and twelve participants. During the first session, parents shared personal experiences concerning their own education. In the second session, parents proposed various ideas for improving schools and weighed the strengths and weaknesses of those potential solutions. Finally, in the third session, parents participated in an “action forum” in which they organized into teams, shared their conclusions and worked on specific solution proposals.</p><p>Since the first KCK Study Circles program, there have been over one hundred meetings, and about 10 percent of the northeast Kansas City population (about 1,676 people) have attended these sessions. Over time, discussion topics have evolved from being strictly about schools and education to city-wide issues such as crime and racism. Overall, the program has been largely successful, particularly because it allows its participants, as opposed to organizers and facilitators, to choose the agenda and topics of discussion. Furthermore, reforms in education have taken place, such as organizing parent support groups, tutoring and mentoring opportunities, and school fundraising events.<a href=""#cite_note-6"" title="""">[7]</a></p><p><a id=""Buffalo_Policing_Circles"" name=""Buffalo_Policing_Circles""></a></p><h3>Buffalo Policing Circles</h3><p>Tense relations between the police and teenagers of Buffalo, N.Y. have made it difficult for community members to reach a common ground in terms of law enforcement, crime prevention, and neighborhood safety. Lack of trust and respect between the police and youth has amplified community stress, sometime escalating to dangerous police-youth confrontations.</p><p>In 2000, the Margaret L. Wendt Foundation and United Way of Buffalo and Erie County started the United Neighborhoods Center in Buffalo, which worked to foster better relations between the police and teenagers. United Neighbors received funding from the Department of Justice and was best known for its problem-solving initiatives. Over 250 youth participated in the study circles in Buffalo. Some objectives of the program included engaging youth in discussing police-community relations and addressing the issue of racial profiling.</p><p>Youth from various organizations and clubs formed teams with police and other community members. These teams met during facilitated events where they were provided discussion guides with sample questions and various viewpoints concerning police-community relations and racial profiling. In order to attract more participants, rap and hip-hop events, drama performances, and games were incorporated into the small group events to encourage conversation and idea-sharing. At one of the events, teenagers and police played a game modeled after Family Feud, called “Community Feud,” to break down existing tensions between the two parties.<a href=""#cite_note-7"" title="""">[8]</a></p><p>The study circles allowed the teams to pinpoint issues underlying police-teen conflicts. The participants realized that teens had minimal outlets for after-school activities and thus used parties as entertainment venues, which were often linked to substance abuse and violence. Angela Jones, program coordinator for the Buffalo Policing Circles, noted some proposed solutions to this issue, including planned meetings to educate teens on rules and guidelines for hosting safe parties. The study circles were successful because they increased policing programs, which resulted in faster response times for 911 calls. However, cuts in police funding and the United Neighborhoods coordinator’s moving to a different community prevented improvements from becoming substantial and permanent.<a href=""#cite_note-8"" title="""">[9]</a></p><p><a id=""Sweden"" name=""Sweden""></a></p><h3>Sweden</h3><p>The use of study circles has been an enduring tradition for Sweden since 1912. It is often considered a “mass phenomenon” because nearly 2 million citizens participate in one or more study circle programs per year. Study associations or organizations often receive funding from the state government and are accountable for promoting and facilitating study circles. In addition, they are responsible for reporting numbers and statistics relating to the study circles. In the early 1900s, common topics for discussion included workers’ rights, the temperance movement, and Free Church movement. However, more recently topics have proven to cover a large spectrum and can depend on the will of coordinator. Some study circles even discuss poetry or certain crafts, though these circles are generally organized by any person with a particular cultural interest as opposed to a study association. Usually participants meet for three hours on one day every week for 10 to 15 meetings.</p><p>Though study associations have faced difficulty in measuring the quality and success of these study circles, it is widely understood that many Swedes participate in at least one program per year and far more participating in several. Also, they have been successful in encouraging all age brackets to get involved, including young adults.<a href=""#cite_note-9"" title="""">[10]</a></p><p><a id=""Evaluation"" name=""Evaluation""></a></p><h1>Evaluation</h1><p><a id=""Strengths"" name=""Strengths""></a></p><h3>Strengths</h3><p>Study circles have been particularly beneficial in fostering community bonds and social solidarity. In the case of the KCK Study Circles, people of diverse backgrounds were able to reach a common ground because they decided their agenda and freely discussed their views, values, and concerns. Networking amongst parents increased, which helped parent involvement in schools and children’s education.<a href=""#cite_note-10"" title="""">[11]</a></p><p>Particularly in Sweden, study circles have often been used to increase literacy amongst citizens. By emphasizing speech as a feature of literacy, study circles offered those lacking formal education a venue for learning language and civic participation. A striking quality found within Swedish study circles is that they are used by half of the state’s population, which proves that study circles can advance the significance of citizen involvement.<a href=""#cite_note-11"" title="""">[12]</a></p><p><a id=""Weaknesses"" name=""Weaknesses""></a></p><h3>Weaknesses</h3><p>The quality of deliberation in a study circles program depends on the dynamics of the group. Some participants may be passive while others are more outspoken. This prevents some voices from being heard, and sometimes speaking opportunities are not equally distributed. Furthermore, the diversity of the group may hinder participants from reaching any consensus, especially if members come from very different backgrounds. If consensus becomes a serious issue, participants may drop out from the group altogether.<a href=""#cite_note-12"" title="""">[13]</a></p><p>Leadership is another primary factor in assessing the success of study circles. If the facilitator does not perform his or her duties properly, the discussions may be too heavily influenced by the facilitator or fail to provide organization and structure. In the case of the Buffalo Policing Circles, the head coordinator’s moving to a different community prevented the program from achieving long-lasting success.<a href=""#cite_note-13"" title="""">[14]</a></p><p><a id=""References"" name=""References""></a></p><h1>References</h1><ol class=""references""><li id=""cite_note-0""><a href=""#cite_ref-0"" title="""">↑</a> Sarah vL.

"<a name=""Definition"" id=""Definition""></a><h2> Definition </h2>
<p>The European Local Democracy Week (ELDW) is an annual event in Europe which fosters local and national participation in promoting the knowledge of local democracy and the idea of democratic participation at a local level. Founded in 2007, this relatively new event occurs every year around October 15th to commemorate the European Charter of Local Self-Government, which was signed on that date in 1985. ELDW is a joint initiative of the Congress of Local and Regional Authorities and the European Committee on Local and Regional Democracy. During the 2010 ELDW over 4000 towns, cities and villages in European countries participated by offering a number of events and activities open to citizens.
</p>
<a name=""Purpose"" id=""Purpose""></a><h2> Purpose </h2>
<p>Overall ELDW seeks to emphasize the importance of local democracy in constructing a democratic Europe and to inform the public and elected representatives how crucial their participation in local affairs is in maintaining a strong local democracy.
</p><p>Elected Representatives & Leaders
Through the events and activities of the ELDW elected representatives and leaders are given a special opportunity to bring local government closer to citizens. Throughout the week they focus on informing citizens of how they operate and what their competences are through direct and close contact, furthermore increasing citizen confidence in them. Local elected representatives and leaders take this opportunity to listen to citizens and discuss subjects of local interest. They inform citizens of various ways to get involved with local government while gaining themselves a better understanding of what the citizens what and need.
</p><p>Citizens 
ELDW provides citizens a chance to get to know their councilors and what their responsibilities are. They get the opportunity to ask their leaders questions and to be listened to. The ELDW aims for citizens to walk away from the week knowing how the local democratic intuitions managing their lives operate and about the various opportunities available for taking part in democratic life at the local level.
</p><p>The Council of Europe
The Council of Europe uses ELDW as a marketing tool to promote local democracy as the basis for building a strong democratic society. Through national media campaigns and the exposure the week gets at the local level, the hope is to reinforce citizens’ perception of local democracy as a common European value.
</p>
<a name=""Process"" id=""Process""></a><h2> Process </h2>
<p>Local authorities may organize different events with their citizens and elected representatives during the second week of October when the ELDW is officially held. 
</p><p>City councils, provincial authorities and regions can choose to contribute to ELDW in two main ways:
1.	Applying as a partner of ELDW, organizing its own initiatives involving citizens and other local partners.
2.	Co-operating with participating local authorities by promoting the institutional logo, supporting their initiatives     financially or providing other resource (printing leaflets, providing equipment, printing ELDW posters)
</p><p>Local institutions who choose to partner with the ELDW organize a variety of activities and events best suiting their area. Types of events include information/communication activities such as forums on local development, production of information material on local authorities, producing an information campaign in the local media, or a special issue of the local authority’s newsletter that focuses on local democracy and the ELDW. 
</p><p>Also held are activities based on exchanges between citizens and local elected representatives like public debates on topics of local interest, lectures on local democracy followed by discussion, meetings and discussions between local elected representatives and community associations, local authority open days, and allowing citizens to visit facilities (i.e. fire stations, schools) run by local authorities.
</p><p>Young people are believed to play an essential role in spreading message ELDW. The participation of youth and children in the week is strongly encouraged through a variety of activities and events. Activities for youth include the organization of a youth council/parliament to discuss issues relevant to young people, visits to local institutions, school visits by elected representatives, mock elections and a variety of other games and events designed to give young people perspective on the life, community and how participating in local democracy can affect them.
</p><p>Typically these types of events are planned over the preceding year and held all throughout the second week of October when the ELDW is officially celebrated. Although, some local institutions choose to  use only a few days out of the week to hold events or choose to celebrate the week at another point in the year more opportune for the community.
</p>
<a name=""History"" id=""History""></a><h2> History </h2>
<p>At the time of the development of the ELDW there were already several existing local democracy events in member states. For example, the Local Government Association of the United Kingdom was already established and had been organizing a “Local Democracy Week” for seven years in England and Wales. 
In 2006 a Joint Working Group consisting of the European Committee on Local and Regional Democracy (CDLR) and the Congress of Local and Regional Authorities was established at the Council of Europe. They felt that organizing local events across the continent with the common label of “European Local Democracy Week” would help citizens understand local democracy as a common European value and a necessity for the construction of a democratic society. With this shared view the Congress and CDLR members of the Working Group initiated the ELDW and promoted the project in their respective member states, obtaining a generally positive reception.
On October 15-16 in 2007 the first ELDW was officially launched at the 15th session of the Ministerial Conference of European Ministers Responsible for Local and Regional Government. Since then the event has expanded to over 4000 European cities, towns and villages. It will continue to be promoted as a “pan-European” event aiming to encourage even more local authorities to join in.

<a name=""Case_Studies"" id=""Case_Studies""></a><h2> Case Studies </h2>
<p>Information/communication activities – Fighting Climate Change Campaign
</p><p>ELDW 2010 had a theme of “the impact of sustainable communities in fighting climate change”. Throughout the continent local authorities offered a number of information/communication events allowing citizens to exchange information and learn more about the subject specifically focusing on the issues of transport and mobility, waste management, using renewable energy sources, saving water and biodiversity.
In Paris for example, the Directorate of Parks and the Environment organized a “nature bus” in various parks and gardens. Residents of Paris could visit the nature bus to learn more about the City authorities’ proposed participatory strategy for drawing up a Biodiversity Plan.
In the city of Portsmouth, UK the free “Fight Climate Change Poster Competition” was held. The competition, aimed at children, called for designs that encouraged other children to do something that would fight climate change. 452 submissions were entered featuring a variety of climate related topics such as saving water energy or using more eco-friendly transportation.
Greece joined the climate change fight as well in the municipality of Lerapetra by offering a number of events aimed at informing the public. The hosted a seminar where a ELDW coordinator presented the ELDW institution, the role of the Council of Europe, and activities of the 2010 ELDW in regard to sustainable development. Also hosted was an open conference with exhibitions for informing the public of the renewable energy systems and creating a more sustainable community.
</p><p>
Activity based on exchanges between citizens and elected representatives – Harvering London Borough Events
</p><p>During the 2010 ELDW the Havering London Burrough showed exemplary organization of events promoting citizen-elected representative contact. Political speed dating along with an interactive blog was used to promote citizen and council exchanges. The speed dating event offered citizens a few minutes to ask councilors about any topic they wished and discuss their own views and concerns with officials. Havering also set up a day where Members of the Cabinet were at the local Market place to talk and listen to residents about issues, concerns and the community. Another successful tool used was a blog written by Council Leader Michael White where local residents could respond with their own comments on the borough and receive feedback from White. The blog received a considerable amount of traffic.
</p><p>
Activities Aimed at Youth -  NIGLA
</p><p>The Northern Ireland Local Government Association (NIGLA) heavily encouraged youth participation in their celebration ELDW 2010. The NIGLA Local Democracy Week is aimed specifically at youth in an effort to dispel political apathy and make them more informed. At the Council Chamber at the Palace Demesne 28 students took the role of Local Councilor and participated in a Council Meeting. Officers from the local Council put forth information and then asked students how they thought services and strategies could be improved, sparking a healthy discussion. Topics included were an Annual Events Program, Partnership Working, Rural Strategy, Waste and Recycling and Communications.  In the Dugannon and South Dugannon Borough Council students and Councilors participated in political speed dating where, like the Havering residents, students had the opportunity to share their views and expectations of Council and what they saw as prominent issues. Also, after delivering speeches to the council, one student was selected as “Mayor of the Day” and had the chance to accompany the current mayor to a public event.
</p>
<a name=""Evaluation"" id=""Evaluation""></a><h2> Evaluation </h2>
<p>The ELDW introduces various beneficial aspects to local communities. It provides invaluable opportunities and education which serve to promote more local political participation and instill in youth the idea of local democracy at a young age. Communities are brought together under the ELDW and it allows more citizens to be heard. Through the events held the citizens become more deliberative, especially in the case of forums, debates and other activities which allow citizens to interact with each other and elected officials (such as the Harvering, London events). The information that is learned through information/communication activities also makes for a more deliberative society in that by being more informed they are better prepared to partake in successful deliberating.
At the local level examples of ELDW vary, but many local authorities could make improvements by holding more events and putting more effort into the week. The regions that take the time to do a lot of planning such as NIGLA, as mentioned above, have a very successful week that youth, adults and even government can walk away from having benefited greatly. 
At the level of the Council of Europe improvements can be made by more promotion of the week. The organizers of the week have done an exceptional job thus far as they have over 47 countries that participate, but that means they have to market the week extra hard to countries that still haven’t made the effort. They might consider taking their promotion to a local level as some countries have committed to celebrating the week but specific local governments of that country choose not to hold events.

<a name=""Definition"" id=""Definition""></a><h2> Definition </h2>

<p>Jury – randomly selected group of citizens of a country that sworn in to participate in deliberation for court to act on behalf of government. In civil courts there are usually six members and in criminal courts there are usually twelve members. However, this number will differ from country to country and in different court structures. The jury is selected from different demographics to represent country, state or city. 
</p><p>
</p>
<a name=""Purpose"" id=""Purpose""></a><h2> Purpose </h2>

<p>The purpose of a jury is to deliberate and come up with a conclusion based on the evidence and witnesses provided. The jury exists to prevent “oppression by the government.""  Everyone is innocent until proven guilty, so it is not defendant’s job to prove innocence it is prosecution’s job to prove guilt. If it is not brought up the jury cannot just assume, they have to make their conclusion/verdict based on information provided. They cannot use their own judgments and opinions. 
In US, each selected juror goes through voir dire, “to say the truth”, to make sure that there are no links between jurors and people involved in the trial. So for example if a person who was preliminary selected to be part of jury will be disqualified or removed if they know the defendant or plaintiff. Lawyers usually want juries who are not legally educated, juries who don't know the legal systems are more easily manipulated. Furthermore jurors that have too much legal knowledge might be disqualified from participating.
US Constitution provides the 6th amendment which entitles citizens the right to a jury trial
Juries must have 6-12 members, less than 6 is unconstitutional
</p><p>
</p>
<a name=""History"" id=""History""></a><h2>  History </h2>

<p>Juries can be taken as back as ancient Greece where higher status citizens were expressing concerns for Athens youth because they thought Socrates were corrupting them. There were anywhere from six to 501 members of jury. 
</p><p>
British 14th century - had to reach unanimous decision in criminal cases 12 members. it was common to incarcerate jury without food and water until verdict is reached. Jurors were prosecuted if later evidence demonstrated error in verdict 
</p><p>1852 Lord Chief Justice Loke, 18th century, choosing jury as it is today 
</p><p>
</p>
<a name=""Examples"" id=""Examples""></a><h2> Examples </h2>

<p>12 angry men - if only jurors worked the way 12 angry men provide, the system would be long corrupt. The juror cannot agree with everybody else’s decision if she/he knows it’s a wrong thing to do. It is unconstitutional to buy a verdict by jurors. Jurors never go outside the evidence and witnesses provided. It is constitutional to deliberate each evidence and witness. Even though it was not shown but they decided to not guilty verdict which started with 11-1 guilty. 
</p><p>Criminal jury - in capital punishment cases the only people that can give the death sentences is a jury
a judge alone cant, so it is very important for jurors to audit each evidence with care before providing verdict. 
</p><p>
</p>
<a name=""First_Famous_Cases"" id=""First_Famous_Cases""></a><h2> First Famous Cases </h2>

<p>Old Baley in London England 1670 Wiiliam Penn  defendant was arrested for bother the Kind with his preaching. The court decided that he broke the common law, which he was trialed for. Penn argued that if it was a common law then it isn’t common because he didn’t know about the law. Several witnesses testified that Penn did preach and based on eyewitness the jury was sent to deliberate. Several times Penn tried to interrupt and object to witnesses and juries but he was sent out of the room to silence. The jury was considerate and couldn’t put Penn in jail. They couldn’t agree that Penn is guilty by giving a speech on the street. The court sent them back three times in order to deliberate and convict Penn of guilt. Each time the jury would come to not guilty verdict. The judge got so furious that he sent them back until they reached a verdict that court would accept. The judge sent them back to the room without any food, drinks, tobacco or fire. Jurors still came out with not guilty verdict, the judge then sent them to jail and to pay 40 marks. They would be released when they paid their fines. The jurors were sitting together with Penn in one cell.  William Penn was sent to jail for contempt of court. Later one of the jurors, Bushell, filed a lawsuit over his imprisonment and won. It was Bushell lawsuit that overthrew English’s Court custom to discipline jurors of what Court thought was a wrong verdict.

<p>As Dr. John Gastil noted in his book, Political Communication and Deliberation, jurors do deliberate fairly well. Most of the deliberation happens in the court when jurors listen to evidence and witnesses. The assertion of self-deliberation then reestablishes in the jury room when jurors began to deliberate.

</p><p>Robert Gooding an Australian philosopher documented that jurors start deliberating within as they watch a trial. So even before coming into the room to deliberate as a group they already have a pretty good idea of the verdict.
</p><p>One of the findings about the jurors is that 90% of the time they already have deliberated and came up with the verdict as they process each evidence and witness on the spot.
</p><p>There are two distinct deliberation processes, one is verdict driven and the other one is evidence driven. Good to say that most of the cases are evidence driven deliberation where the jury is actually taking piece by piece, evidence by evidence, and witness by witness to come to the conclusion. Where as in verdict driven, the deliberation views how many jurors have arrived at a verdict.

Electronic direct democracy is sometimes referred to by many other names, such as open source governance and collaborative governance.</p><p>EDD requires electronic voting or some way to register votes on issues electronically. As in any direct democracy, in an EDD, citizens would have the right to vote on legislation, author new legislation, and recall representatives (if any representatives are preserved). Technology for supporting EDD has been researched and developed at the Florida Institute of Technology, where the technology is used with student organizations. Numerous other software development projects are underway, along with many supporting and related projects. Several of these projects are now collaborating on a cross-platform architecture, under the umbrella of the Metagovernment project.</p><p>EDD as a system is not fully implemented in a political government on national or regional level anywhere in the world, although several initiatives are currently forming <a href=""/organizations/e2d-international"" title=""E2D International"">E2D_International</a> . On communal level <a href=""/organizations/demoex"" title=""Demoex"">Demoex</a> is active since 2002 as the first EDD party in the world that had an elected representative. Ross Perot was a prominent advocate of EDD when he advocated ""electronic town halls"" during his 1992 and 1996 Presidential campaigns in the United States. Switzerland, already partially governed by direct democracy, is making progress towards such a system.</p><p><a href=""/methods/liquid-democracy"" title=""Liquid Democracy"">Liquid_Democracy</a>, or direct democracy with delegable proxy, would allow citizens to choose a proxy to vote on their behalf while retaining the right to cast their own vote on legislation. The voting and the appointment of proxies could be done electronically.</p>",en,195,Electronic Direct Democracy

"<h3>Definition</h3><p> </p>The Wikivote methodology was developed by a Russian company Wikivote. It is based on a wiki approach to document composition. Project participants treat the the document, such as a law or a regulations  as a construction kit, consisting of blocks, which can be discussed, evaluated and modified.  The platform attracts the open network community to participating in creative and collaborative problem solving. The spectrum of possible implications extends from simple actions, such as collecting and re-use of existing knowledge and content objects, links etc. to solving complex tasks of creating collaborative documents, standards, books etc. This methodology helps to  select the most appropriate and meaningful suggestions on the content of the document. The voting mechanism allows to rate the suggestions and calculate the ranking of every participant. Participants’ votes and the ranking systems help to manage the information noise.  <h3>Steps</h3>  Step 1. The initial draft of the bill is put together by a legislative committee, consisting of a limited number of professional legislators. It generally reflects the previous version of the bill, if any and amendments made by the legislators themselves. The initial draft if passed to the Wikivote team.<br /><br />Step 2. The draft document is decomposed into segments is published on the platform.  For example laws are decomposed into items. <br /><br />Step 3. Every participant can create only one version of an item. Both initial and new versions of the items are voted for and against. If a participant thinks that the item should be modified, he can create his own version of it, which in its turn, is evaluated and commented on by other participants.<br /><br />Step 4. Items with maximum votes are selected. All segments are rated according to the participants’ votes and a new draft of the document, approved by the community is built. At the same time the rank of the participant is calculated according to the data of his involvement.<br /><br />Step 5. The draft law is passed to the legislative committee who approve the most sound and reasonable suggestions. Improper and contradicting suggestions are excluded.<br /><br />Step 6. The second draft of the law is posted on the Wikivote platform for the final round of evaluation and consideration. The segments are voted for and commented by the participants again.<br /><br />Step 7. The draft law is passed to the Parliament for approval. <h3>Problems and Purpose</h3><p> </p><h3>History</h3><p> </p><h3>Participant Selection</h3><p> </p><h3>Deliberation, Decisions, and Public Interaction</h3><p> </p><h3>Influence, Outcomes, and Effects</h3><p> </p><h3>Analysis and Criticism</h3><p> </p><h3>Secondary Sources</h3><p> </p><h3>External Links</h3><p> </p><a href=""http://www.wikivote.ru/"">http://www.wikivote.ru/</a><br />Facebook:<a href=""http://www.facebook.com/groups/wikivote/""> http://www.facebook.com/groups/wikivote/</a><h3>Notes</h3><p> </p>",en,448,Wikivote

"<h3>Definition</h3><p><strong>Occupy Vancouver Spokes Council Model</strong></p><p><em>Submitted by the Spokes Council Work Group</em></p><p>(A Living Document)</p><p>Dec 12th 2011</p><p> </p><p><strong>Brief History of the Spokes Council:</strong></p><p>The spokes council model is a structure for democratic process that has been used for many years. It has been employed by many organizations and struggles including the Zapatistas, Chaipas, the Women’s Movement, Anti-Nuclear Movement, and Global Justice Movement. It is also currently being used by Occupy Wall Street and Occupy Portland.</p><p> </p><p><strong>How does the Spokes Council work?</strong></p><p>The spokes council works like the spokes of a wheel. It is designed to allow for large group participation and small group discussion to work together with consensus. Each committee, caucus, or outside organization consenses on a representative, a rotating spokesperson or ‘spoke’ who meets in the middle with the other spokes for form the council. The committees, caucuses or outside organizations sit directly behind the spoke for direct consultation on decisions being made.</p><p><strong>Committees</strong></p><p>Committees are groups that contribute to Occupy Vancouver’s operations regularly. They are open to everyone and can only exclude people for constant disruption or violating General Assembly Agreements.</p><p><strong>Caucus</strong></p><p>A Caucus is a self determined group of people who share a common experience of marginalization by society at large.</p><p><strong>Outside Organization</strong></p><p>Outside Organizations are organizations that have given public support to Occupy Vancouver and wish to collaborate with our efforts.</p><p><strong>Spoke</strong></p><p>A spoke is a rotating, agreed-upon representative of a committee, caucus or outside organization. Spokes are considered a neutral spokes person, not the unilateral decision maker for the group. They should be thought of as a facilitator rather than temporary leaders.</p><p><strong>General Assembly and the Spokes Council</strong></p><p>The General Assembly will continue to happen with the Spokes Council operating with a mandate from the General Assembly. The Spokes Council will oversee committee work and logistical matters leaving the General Assembly open to more broad visioning, goal setting, and more open ended political discussion.</p><p><strong>Open Access and Transparency</strong></p><p>- Anyone may attend the Spokes Council</p><p>- Anyone can participate in the council by joining a committee or caucus. Also new and non-affiliated members can participate in the open caucus which has a voice but no say in the Spokes Council consensus process.</p><p>- The Spokes Council will take place in a well publicized space.</p><p>- Minutes will be taken at every Spokes Council and posted online.</p><p>- The Spokes Council will be livestreamed whenever possible.</p><p>- All decisions made by the Spokes Council will be reported back to the General Assembly for questions or concerns.</p><p><strong>Proposed Schedule</strong></p><p>The Spokes Council will meet on Tuesday at 7pm and Sunday at 1pm every week.</p><p><strong>History of this proposal</strong></p><p>This proposal is based on the work done at Occupy Wall Street and Occupy Portland. You can find their models here:</p><p><a href=""http://www.nycga.net/spokes-council/"" target=""_blank"">http://www.nycga.net/spokes-council/</a></p><p><a href=""http://occupyportland.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Spokes-Proposal-PDF-FINAL.pdf"" target=""_blank"">http://occupyportland.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Spokes-Proposal-PDF-FINAL.pdf</a></p><p>These models were used as templates to be built on. We held 5 work groups to gather information about problems people had with the model and work out mechanisms to correct the issues raised. The first work group had over 30 people attend and created a long list of potential issues to be worked out. The subsequent work groups tackled each problem on the list while opening the floor to new issues until there were no more foreseeable problems with the model. Like all documents in Occupy Vancouver, this is a living document, and as such, is open to the process of revision at any time.</p><p><strong>Benefits</strong></p><p><strong>Access:</strong> This model creates greater access for those outside of Occupy Vancouver and within. It has been difficult to find committees and caucuses within the General Assembly. This creates a central location for people to easily find a group they wish to participate in.</p><p><strong>Transparency:</strong> The Spokes Council enables greater communication of committee work, roles, and responsibilities.</p><p><strong>Process:</strong> With a clear mandate to make decisions over committee work and logistical matters and because of the efficiency of the model, the Spokes Council will greatly increase our ability to make decisions and follow through on them.</p><p><strong>Marginalization:</strong> The General Assembly is currently not an empowering model for marginalized people. The ability for marginalized groups to create a caucus and have a spoke on the council will allow for greater participation from marginalized voices.</p><p><strong>General Assembly:</strong> Taking the logistical and committee work into the Spokes Council frees up the General Assembly to talk more about broad visioning and goal setting while at the same time opening it up for more open ended political discussion. The General Assembly remains the highest decision making body.</p><p><strong>Trust: </strong>The General Assembly does not give participants much time to interact with one another or build meaningful relationships. A more structured environment for the group members to interact creates even more time to communicate and build relationships through continued interaction. This will do a lot towards building trust within our movement.</p><p><strong>Spokes Council Model in Detail</strong></p><p><strong>The Spokes Council and the General Assembly</strong></p><p>The General Assembly will continue to operate in conjunction with the Spokes Council. The General Assembly will define the goals, vision, character, and spirit of Occupy Vancouver.</p><p>The Spokes Council operates with a mandate to oversee committee work and logistical decisions. The Spokes Council must report its actions to the General Assembly to allow for questions and concerns.</p><p>Sometimes there will be overlap in decisions made by the General Assembly and Spokes Council. In such a situation a decision made by the General Assembly that directly affects the logistical realm of the Spokes Council should be brought to the Spokes Council for consensus. Likewise decisions made by the Spokes Council that greatly affect the goals of Occupy Vancouver will be brought to the General Assembly for consensus.</p><p>Because of the General Assembly’s authority over the Spokes Council, if members of the General Assembly feel that a Spokes Council decision goes against the core values of Occupy Vancouver or General Assembly agreements they can form a work group to discuss the issue to create a veto proposal. The proposal is then brought to the General Assembly and put through the consensus process. If consensus is achieved on the veto, the Spokes Council must cease work on the decision and rework the idea for future General Assembly approval.</p><p>It is mandatory that a record keeper be established before the Spokes Council can begin. When the Spokes Council breaks to speak with their groups the spokes are responsible for making sure someone is a record keeper within their respective groups.</p><p><strong>Role of the Spokes</strong></p><p>The Spokes Council is made up of rotating representatives from caucuses, committees, and outside organizations. Spokes are considered neutral spokes person not the decision maker for their groups; they must share the differing views and decisions that their groups have come to consensus on with the Spokes Council. The spoke is a facilitator rather than temporary leader of their group. The spokes must rotate and can be recalled by their group at any time.</p><p>The function of the council is not to unilaterally make decisions for the rest of Occupy Vancouver. Issues are brought to the Spokes Council, the council then breaks into their respective groups to discuss the issues and come to consensus. The council then reassembles and reports the diversity of opinion and consensuses reached. A committee or caucus must send a spoke and at least 2 other members to the Spokes Council.</p><p>Dissenting voices in a committee or caucus that feel their voice is not being represented by their spoke are encouraged by the Spokes Council that try and resolve the issue within their group. If differing or dissenting opinions are not being represented in the Spokes Council, the members of the spoke’s group can show a point of process and the Spokes Council is responsible for addressing the issue. If a group feels so strongly that the spoke is misrepresenting the group’s views, the group can ‘mic check’ to interrupt the spokes council and recall their spoke.</p><p>Note: It was recommended that a comment box be created for dissenting views to be recorded.</p><p><strong>Definition of Groups in the Spokes Council</strong></p><p><strong>Committees</strong> are groups that contribute to the operations of Occupy Vancouver regularly. They are open to everyone and can only exclude people for constant disruption or violation of General Assembly agreements. Each committee is responsible for one aspect of Occupy Vancouver’s day to day logistical operations; for example, Media Committee, Direct Action Committee, Legal Committee etc... Committee’s spokes have a say in the consensus process of the Spokes Council.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Caucuses</strong> are self determined groups of people that share a common experience of marginalization from society at large. These caucuses have a say in the consensus process of the Spokes Council to create space for greater participation from marginalized voices in our decision making process.</p><p>Both committees and caucuses must have at least 4 members and be registered with the Spokes Council to be allowed a spoke on the council. There is no maximum to the number of people allowed on a committee or caucus.</p><p><strong>Outside organizations</strong> are organizations that have given public support for Occupy Vancouver and wish to collaborate with Occupy Vancouver’s efforts. They do not have a say in the consensus process of the Spokes Council except in decisions that directly affect them. Their spoke does not have to rotate and they do not have to attend a Spokes Council if they do not wish to. They also have to register with the Spokes Council to have the right to a spoke.</p><p>Both committees and outside organizations must have a mandate approved by the Spokes Council or General Assembly.</p><p><strong>Open caucus</strong> is a caucus that is always available for anyone to join and participate in. This caucus is primarily aimed at allowing non-affiliated and new members of occupy to see how the process works and allow their voices to be heard. This caucus has no say in the consensus process of the Spokes Council but has a spoke and the ability to have its opinions voiced.</p><p><strong>Livestream spoke</strong> is a representative from the Livestream Committee that is charged with representing the views and ideas of those on the Occupy Vancouver Livestream (<a href=""http://www.livestream.com/occvan"">www.livestream.com/occvan</a>). This spoke will have no say in the consensus process of the Spokes Council until an appropriate mechanism is in place to allow for a fair consensus of the livestream to be reached. They are only there to give voice to the opinions of those on livestream.</p><p><strong>Moderated seat of dissent </strong>is a seat on the spokes council that is reserved for a moderator whose sole purpose is to voice any dissenting views that feels their voice is not being represented by their spoke. Any member of a caucus or committee who feels their opinion is not being properly represented by their spoke can approach this moderator anytime during the Spokes Council. This moderator does not have a say in the consensus process of the Spokes Council.</p><p><strong>Basic Agenda</strong></p><p>-          Open</p><p>-          Spokes’ rounds</p><p>-          Basis of Unity read un-mic checked</p><p>-          Role of spoke is explained</p><p>-          Registrations of new Caucuses, Committees, and Outside Organizations</p><p>-          Follow up on old proposals the Spokes Council came to consensus on at the last meeting.</p><p>-          Body of the meeting*</p><p>-          Close</p><p>*The body of the meeting was left open. This was to give the Spokes Council and the facilitation team the freedom to choose how to facilitate the meeting and how long to discuss specific agenda items.</p><p>An example of the body of the meeting would look like this:</p><p>-          Old proposal that was postponed at the last meeting open for discussion</p><p>-          First new proposal for discussion</p><p>-          Second new proposal</p><p>-          Committee announcements</p><p><strong>Meeting times</strong></p><p>The Spokes Council will meet on Tuesday at 7pm and Sunday at 1pm every week.  Once a month there will be a Spokes Council meeting that all registered committees must attend, or be required to submit a report explaining their nonattendance.</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><h3>Notes</h3><p> </p>",en,518,Spokes Council - Occupy Vancouver
"<h3>Definition</h3><p>A workers’ council is a method of governance by workers of themselves through selected delegates sent to represent them either through direct positions of leadership or through communication with those in positions of power or management. The management of a workplace or an enterprise comes together with the selected delegates to negotiate and bargain on issues selected by the workers to be the agenda of the discussions.</p><p>A concept that was born in the middle of the rise of communism in early 20th century Russia, its original intent was to transform the labor relations to turn production into something collectively owned by the working class. In its current-day application, it has been implemented in different scales and in varying degrees in different countries. From small-scale applications such as in smaller businesses seeking to give voice to its employees to large-scale implementations such as the European Union’s crafting of the <a href=""http://www.etuc.org/r/57"">European Works Council</a> (EWC) which, in part, serves to ensure that workers are assisted when they express desire for delegate-based representation, it has existed in different sizes. Beyond just scale, it has also served as a tool to open up different levels of participation to workers: from being just similar to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_bargaining"">collective bargaining</a> by encouraging mere negotiations with employers to truly turning over the power of the workplace to its employees by allowing the delegates to essentially be the management team. Ultimately and in each case, it functions to increase the participation of the workers in decision-making processes that affect their employment and general matters related to their trade.</p><h3>Problems and Purpose</h3><p>The creation of a workers’ council puts collective administration into the hands of the workers through their selection of temporary, revocable delegates who are answerable to the mass assembly who selected them. It seeks to reduce the separation between the majority of the workers and the decision-making processes within places of employment or enterprises by ensuring they have representatives. In some cases, the delegates are not merely negotiators but end up serving as the managing members.</p><p>Due to its socialist roots, it does endanger a more inclusive discussion among its participants as they are more likely to be polarized towards the more communist or socialist end of the spectrum. Similarly, its roots have impeded it from being received openly by less socialist societies that could potentially have been more open to increased participation from workers in workplace decision making processes.</p><h3>History</h3><p>Workers' councils first came into existence in Russia as part of the rise of communism in 1905. With the increasing focus on class struggles and giving power to the proletariat, the realization of such a world was devised in various ways. In the workplace, not only was ownership of the means of production thought to rightfully belong to the proletariat, so was the ability to decide all workplace and labor-related issues. The materialization of this within the workforce was in the form of workers' councils. It was thought that the selection of a mass assembly of temporary and revocable delegates would be the most efficient and minimally corrupt way of turning proletarian dictatorship into reality.</p><p>Outside of Russia, they rose into prominence during the German Revolution in 1918. As part of the captivation of power from the imperial government, workers and soldiers became unwilling to cooperate without a stake and a say in the new order. With the rise of Germany as a republic came the rise of workers' and soldiers' councils in Germany which gave a greater sense of involvement and participation to all through the use of delegates.</p><p>Over time, the decline of communism in Europe led to the reduction of the direct management of the workers of themselves. However, the ability of workers to participate was not necessarily forgotten or devalued. In fact, in September 1994, the European Works Council was established. It ensured the right of each worker to being consulted and being informed of company decisions at the EU level through their representatives. </p><p>As of yet, the only model most similar to the original conception of this participatory method that has been used in the United States came into being in the 1920s. The Workers' Council of the United States was a faction of the Socialist Party of America. However, it was short-lived due to problems within the political party. The applications of it in modern-day America are not much different from a typical labor union.</p><h3>Participant Selection</h3><p>There are two kinds of participants that could be broken down in discussing a workers’ council. The former is the general group that takes on this method. The latter is the selection of the delegates within the workers’ council that take on the primary role of communicator between the workers and the management or, in some cases, take on the role of management.</p><p>The method allowing worker governance of and by themselves is open to all who want to adapt it. However, there are systems in place that have allowed public policy to back the creation of these councils. Particularly, the European Works Council encourages the establishment of these by mandating them for larger companies operating at the European Union level (further discussed in the Influence, Outcomes, and Effects sub-heading) and obligating smaller companies to establish them should their workers express a desire for them.</p><p>As for the latter participation selection, this is often decided through an election. The delegates are selected by mass assemblies who nominate and vote on them. An important and quite consistent aspect of this selection of delegates involves the understanding that they are temporary, revocable and ultimately answerable to the assembly who chose them.</p><h3>Deliberation, Decisions, and Public Interaction</h3><p>The deliberative and decision-making aspects of a workers’ council appear in three parts:</p><p>First, there is the selection of the delegates to represent the workers. There is no particular or uniform way that this has been conducted. However, as mentioned above, the most common way has been through elections among mass assemblies.</p><p>Second, there is the decision making process where the workers decide on their agenda. Often this is also conducted within a mass assembly. The workers play the role of the ""general public"" and vote on the issues they want to be discussed. Additionally, they vote on what their stances are on those chosen issues. Subsequently, they communicate these with the delegates who are then to relay this information to the management of the company and pursue these decided interests for them. </p><p>Lastly, there is the communication and negotiation between the delegates and the top management. In a more complete cycle of decision-making and information-sharing, not only do delegates share the concerns and viewpoints of the workers, those in positions of leadership or management with access to company information are ideally to divulge this information. By doing so, the delegates are expected to share this information with fellow employees to allow for a better informed agenda and decision-making.</p><h3>Influence, Outcomes, and Effects</h3><p>As workers’ councils emerged out of loosely defined ideas that merely intended to shift control of the means of production back to the proletariat, it has taken on different forms in different places throughout history.</p><p>The most profound and widespread rise of the use of this method has been in Europe among members of the <a href=""http://europa.eu/"">European Union</a> (EU). With the establishment of the European Works Council, companies with at least 1,000 employees and with at least 150 employees in two different European Union member states are, under a directive, obligated to set up workers' councils to select delegates. These delegates then serve as the representative of the workers at the EU level. Not only are these representatives sent to communicate the demands and desires of the assembly who elected them, the participation of workers is ensured through the ECW's policy of transparency for the companies. This means that companies have an obligation to divulge company information to delegates to be shared with the workers.</p><h3>Analysis and Criticism</h3><p>Despite the seemingly good efforts of a workers’ council to promote the level of participation of workers in a workplace by bridging communication between them and the top management at a place of employment or enterprise, it has also attracted criticism because of its historical ties to socialism, communism and Leninism. Instead of being perceived as a democratic means to allow the participatory rule of the workers of themselves, it is seen as something that endangers a capitalistic enterprise. This has impeded its spread in some cultures that do not perceive those associations positively. More specifically, while European countries have been the most receptive to the formation of workers’ councils going so far as to mandate worker representation, the United States extends its having the lowest rates of union representation among developed nations to the relatively low levels of prevalence and knowledge of workers’ councils.</p><p>Additionally, even with those not critical of the Marxist, communist or Leninist roots of this method, it still has potential problems tied to the lack of uniformity on what is expected of it. The deliberative and decision-making aspects of it, if not very conscientiously planned, could just be another field through which politicking of dominant and powerful interests within the workplace could be reinforced.</p><p>Another problematic aspect is the unrealistic expectation that workers will have the leisure time to participate in mass assemblies. While the benefits of making time for such a gathering would probably outweigh the costs, in the labor industry where profit is important, there is a weak incentive for employers or the management of enterprises to want to encourage such councils.</p><p>Lastly, while its implementation in some instances does indeed lead to greater participation and inclusion of the diverse viewpoints of workers, it can also serve to create a mere illusion of that. More specifically there are instances when the delegates can choose even more selective delegates among themselves. From the large assembly to an increasingly minimized number of delegates selected for easier negotiations, a workers' council could create the illusion of representation without serving as such in actuality.</p><h3>Secondary Sources</h3><p>""<a href=""http://www.marxists.org/subject/left-wing/gik/1938/workers-councils.htm#h8"">Workers Councils</a>"".

"<h3>Definition</h3><p>VoterMedia is an incentive structure for encouraging public interest media to develop, to flourish and to cover issues that matter to a voter community. A typical first-step implementation is a blog competition in a small democracy such as a student union or a municipality. Voters allocate a limited budget of community funds among various competing blogs. This <a href=""http://votermedia.org/publications/VoterMediaAsParticipatoryBudgeting.pdf"">can be seen as a variant</a> of <a href=""http://participedia.net/methods/participatory-budgeting"">Participatory Budgeting</a>.</p><h3>Problems and Purpose</h3><p>The broad purpose is to improve the policies of democracies and corporations, by better connecting elected leaders with voters, improving voter information and making leaders more accountable for serving the voters' interests.</p><p>Although the existing voting systems in democracies and corporations are already intended to make leaders accountable for serving the voters' interests, those systems fall far short of their ideal intended performance. The 2008 financial crisis is a recent example. VoterMedia is based on the following diagnosis of the causes of such problems:</p><p>The main cause is the voters' free-rider problem. Voting is a collective decision process, and like any collective, it suffers from serious incentive problems. My vote affects everyone else, and everyone else's vote affects me. Voting well requires time, effort, and perhaps money to become well informed. In a typical large voter community, the expected impact of my vote on myself is very small, so I have little incentive to spend time or money to become well informed.</p><p>This is an important part of the reason why private sector media do not provide adequate information to support informed voter decisions -- voters lack the incentive to pay for it <em>individually</em>. However, as a group, voters do have an incentive to pay for information <em>collectively</em>. VoterMedia enables them to do so in a competitive framework.</p><p>Althugh it may seem a circular argument to solve the voter information problem by voting on competing information sources, the reputations of the competing sources help to resolve this circularity. The blogs (or other media) become part of the democratic system of checks and balances.</p><h3>History</h3><p>Votermedia was originally conceived in 1988 at the University of California, Berkeley, for the purpose of informing and empowering corporate shareowners. Shareowners would vote to allocate a limited budget of corporate funds to competing providers of information about management policies and director election candidates. However, resistance by corporate boards, management and institutional investors has so far prevented any implementation in corporations.<br /><br />Instead, votermedia has been implemented experimentally at student unions and municipalities in the Vancouver, Canada area since 2007. The longest and most successful votermedia implementation so far is at UBC AMS, the University of British Columbia's student union (Alma Mater Society) -- see the Participedia Case on this (now being written).</p><h3>Participant Selection</h3><p><strong>1. Selection of a community:</strong> VoterMedia is designed to help a community of voters (e.g. 1,000 or more) that elect leaders to deploy a substantial annual budget (e.g. $250,000 or more). VoterMedia costs a minimum of about $4,000 per year to be effective. (This is a budget for blog awards. VoterMedia.org is probably willing to help administer the contest for free.) It works best with cooperation from the elected leaders, especially since the funding typically comes from the community budget. So far we have had the most success with university student unions, and have started testing the system with municipal governments. It works better in communities with general access to the internet, such as via public libraries.</p><p><strong>2. Selection of blogs:</strong> On a general principle of freedom of the press, the competition should be as open as reasonably possible. Contest administrators should have little or no discretion to decide if any blogs should not be allowed to enter. In some of our test implementations at UBC, the sponsor decided to limit entry to UBC students, and to require that most of the blog's content be related to UBC.</p><p><strong>3. Selection of voters:</strong> Ideally, the eligible voters in VoterMedia should be everyone eligible to vote in the community's elections. This can be achieved by having the VoterMedia voting on the same ballot as a community election. However, a continuous online VoterMedia ballot is also helpful, even if the participating voters will not exactly match those who vote in an election.</p><h3>Deliberation, Decisions, and Public Interaction</h3><p>The voter community can participate in several ways. Anyone (or any group) can start a blog and enter the competition. Voters are encouraged to read the blogs, comment on them, and vote to allocate shares of the funding to the blogs they find worthwhile. Elected leaders often read the blogs and sometimes participate with comments.</p><p>The blogs fulfill the function of active news media. They inform the voter community, especially during election campaigns, but also throughout the year.</p><h3>Influence, Outcomes, and Effects</h3><p>Here are quotes from our video <a href=""http://votermedia.org/videos/3"">How VoterMedia Affects Election Campaigns</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Bijan Ahmadian, AMS President 2010-2011:</p><p>""VoterMedia has definitely made the election process more accessible.<br />...voter media really play an important role and have really been, centre of gravity for voters to come together and discuss issues, discuss candidates, discuss their values, and give candidates an opportunity to respond, to engage with the voters. And it just feels more like a democracy, than it used to, I think, from my perspective.""</p><p>Alex Lougheed, AMS VP Academic 2008-2009:</p><p>""...it's definitely, definitely improved the quality of candidates that run in the elections. And the reason for that is there's far more scrutiny, and candidates have to work their butt off quite a bit more, in order to just make ends meet. As a candidate, it's really common to get a ton of emails from each of the [voter media], may they have questionnaires, may they want interviews, may they want to do photo shoots, any of those kinds of things. And that's really increased the amount of public scrutiny on those officials. They're now aware, and they have to be more cognizant of the issues that are at hand, and they also have to have ideas, and they have to be able to contribute to that dialog...""</p></blockquote><p>And from our video <a href=""http://votermedia.org/videos/2"">VoterMedia at UBC</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Jason Ng, Blogger, <em>Social Capital</em>:<br /><br />""I think one of the challenges that UBC has always been dealing with over the past few years is: You've got a campus of 45,000 students; that's enough for a pretty big town. And everyone has different interests, everyone's from all kinds of places, and it's hard to bring that community together. And voter funded media has helped start that. It's helped bring together students that were not interested, necessarily, in student politics before. And helped them realize that a lot of the issues that affect UBC go beyond students who have a direct interest in politics, and really affect all the students that are part of the community for the years that they're here. And [VoterMedia] has helped start that and helped generate a greater interest. I think we're seeing that reflected through better voter turnout, through better attendance at voter-related events. That hasn't happened before in previous years, partly because of the support that voter funded media has provided.""</p><p>Alex Lougheed, AMS VP Academic 2008-2009:<br /><br />""... having those eyes going towards a student voice that's well informed, has been instrumental, not only as a tool for student governments to get their message across, but also as a tool for the student body to get their message across to the student governments.""</p></blockquote><p> </p><h3>Analysis and Criticism</h3><p> </p><h3>Secondary Sources</h3><p>Links to press coverage are at <a href=""http://votermedia.org/clippings"">votermedia.org/clippings</a>.

"<h3>Definition</h3><p>Democs (Deliberative Meetings Organised by Citizens) is a deliberation method that takes the form of  a card game that enables small groups of citizens to learn about and discuss complex scientific, political and ethical issues. Democs is an interactive and engaging process to support deliberation, learning, and possible conclusion with decision making. As a deliberation method Democs is not only about innovations that produce policy recommendations but also to aim to bring citizens together to deliberate on public issues. Democs allows individuals to learn or extend their knowledge on complex issues, to share their experiences and values and to understand the experiences and values of others.</p><h3>Problems and Purpose</h3><p>Democs relies on increased citizen capacity and engagement. Elitist democratic theorists argue that average citizens lack the political and intellectual capacity to engage and make decisions concerning national and foreign issues. For Schumpeter (1943) citizens can rationally judge in their professional and private spheres, however concerning political issues citizens lack 'effective individual volition and command of facts' (261). Citizens lack responsibility, knowledge and are easy to manipulate by outside forces, because political affairs are so removed from the majority of people's lives. As Fishkin and Laslett (2006) note, the public's most basic political knowledge is appalling by any standards (11). One explanation is that what Downs et al (2006)) call 'rational ignorance' (11). For the average citizen it is too costly and time consuming to become well-informed for most complex policy questions. Yet citizens are confident that their opinion is unlikely to make any difference, hence they rationally choose to be ignorant.</p><p>Democs focuses not only on sharing views but also on the providing of access to accurate, balanced and clear actual information. Fishkin (1995) argues that a 'measure of reasonable democratic decision is what would people decide if they were informed'. The design of Democs is based on deliberation without experts hence its avoids 'audience democracy' -passivity and one way-interactions ( Fishkin, 2006:6). Game materials are created in advance by experts with the aim to 'manage cognitive load' (nef, 2011). Introducing information on a new and complex subject can create difficulties, as a result information is presented in ‘bite size’ chunks on various sets of cards that present a collection of view points. Participants do not require preparation which makes participation more open and accessible.</p><h3>History</h3><p>Democs was created by the New Economic Foundation (nef) in the early 2000s due to growing interest in engagement with public through deliberative practices.</p><p>Democs was to be used as part of mass national campaigns on ICT and the NHS such as Who Sees What? and was a part of a self-initiative for schools, grass-roots organisations or individuals for educational purposes. </p><p>Currently Democs is adapted for use across Europe through PlayDecide- a web-based project where Democs on science topics are available for download.</p><h3>Participant Selection</h3><p>Democs is innovative as a method of engagement with the wider public as it is more open to participation compared to traditional methods such as citizens juries which require invitation. Designed for small groups, this ensures that a would-be inaccessible location is not an obstacle as it can be played everywhere, from the community centre, classroom, to a cafe or somebody's living room. Democs is flexible as it can be adapted to any age and for a variety of complex issues - from discussion on stem cell research for schoolchildren to synthetic biology discussions for adults. Besides, in contrast to most public engagement activities such as citizens’ juries and deliberative polling, where participation is by invitation-only and not by interest, Democs gives an opportunity to lower formal barriers of entry and to open new spaces for anyone who would like to take part. Democs can be used under an umbrella of one project or organisation or even an interested individual, hence discussions can be held within their existing social networks.</p><p>The design of the game, complete with simple instructions is made with the intention to give people confidence to organise their own events (Whitehead, 2010). This can be especially attractive for engaging a hard-to-reach group. Game design avoids passivity and promotes collaboration through engagement in social issues through themes, narratives, roles, settings, and character. Due to its design, deliberation takes place without experts or facilitators which creates an informal and relaxed atmosphere. Democs provides a familiar structure and a safe space that will appeal to inexperienced participants. For example, 93% of participants of the Democs programme by the Welcome Trust, agreed that, ‘I felt safe to say what I felt and thought’ (Walker, 2010). By embracing openness through design, Democs makes it possible to engage with a significantly larger numbers of participants.</p><p>Democs kits are freely downloadable and can be found at : <a href=""http://www.neweconomics.org/projects/democs"">www.neweconomics.org/projects/democs</a>.</p><p>In the Decide format in a range of European languages on various topics : <a href=""http://www.playdecide.eu/"">www.playdecide.eu</a>.</p><p>On Isotope ( Informing Science Outreach and Public Engagement ) on science topics : <a href=""http://www.nationalstemcentre.org.uk/elibrary/collection/533/democs#collection-resources"">http://www.nationalstemcentre.org.uk/elibrary/collection/533/democs#collection-resources</a>.</p><h3>Deliberation, Decisions, and Public Interaction</h3><p>The game usually takes 60 to 90 minutes among small groups of people (between 5-9 players). Each Democs kit includes a deck of cards representing key facts, opinions and examples about a particular topic.</p><p>The process takes three stages:</p><p>The first stage is learning. Citizens discover a given story card in which citizens explore an imaginary narrative of people who are affected by an issue. Citizens evaluate the importance of each card and key issues which encourage them to critically engage with the meaning of the information. In the end, citizens absorb a full range of information and viewpoints available.</p><p>The second stage involves analysing the chosen cards when citizens categorise them in groups and look for linkages among them. Citizens are expected to agree or disagree on the meaning which would lead to a discussion. In this phase citizens should have explored and gathered information, and started to think about the implications.</p><p>In the third stage citizens apply their knowledge to make a decision according to the purpose of the event. The most commonly used approach is when in the end of the game citizens vote and rate on a particular policy position. In the end citizens try to formulate a consensus position in that they can find some level of agreement (Whitehead, 2010).</p><h3>Influence, Outcomes, and Effects</h3><p>Democs does not only produce policy recommendations but also has an educational role and potential - 'an opportunity for citizens to develop their political knowledge, skills and virtues' which will improve the character of public opinion (Smith, 2005:40). Citizens can participate in Democs without prior knowledge or preparation. For example, Democs was used in a one year project (April 2005-March 2006) in secondary schools with 1,189 participants. The aim was to enhance the ability of students to understand and discuss complex scientific issues such as neuroscience, GM food and stem cell research. The results showed that by playing Democs 81% of students enhanced their scientific knowledge, 63% of students thought that they understood more about contemporary scientific decision making and ethical issues, and 70% of students had been able to evaluate the impact of scientific developments or processes on people, communities or the environment. This experience helped to involve students who didn’t take a science as a subject and allowed informality in order to encourage to participate (nef, 2006).</p><p>In another example, Democs was used by the Welcome Trust under the Medicine in Society programme, with an aim to increase knowledge about particular issues and to incline more citizens to take part in public affairs. 350 people participated from October 2001 to January 2003 during the campaign. Understanding of views different to their own increased for 70% of participants, more sympathy for 25%, and a large majority of participants identified dilemmas in their feeling for others (nef, 2003). For 82 participants of Democs sessions on synthetic biology, for participants who didn't have knowledge of the issue prior to play, Democs opened up questions on the issue, while for those already with some knowledge of the issues Democs aided them in understanding deeper ethical issues involved (Bruce, 2010).</p><p>In general, evaluations suggest that Democs 'promotes collective learning', ‘the development of a greater appreciation for the diversity of opinions and the complexity of the issues' (Smith, 2005, 47). Furthermore, Democs produces confidence and an interest to continue investigation in explored subjects and for participants to take further action (nef, 2011).</p><p>Democs therefore has the potential for the 'development of political agency and consciousness' and 'self transformation' (Warren, 1992). Citizens who are empowered by such participation in decision making processes are subject to transformative effects on their power of thought, feeling and action. Pateman (1970) describes this as citizens receiving 'social training'- how to be public as well as private citizens. Citizens would become more tolerant to difference, knowledgeable, sensitive to reciprocity, and cooperative as increased democracy transforms individualist and conflicting interests into common interest (Warren, 1992). Participation allows the development of democratic skills as well as having a psychological effect. The role of education is to restore citizen capacity to act (Freire, 1972). Individuals will feel that he/she is making an impact, hence it is 'worthwhile to perform civil duties'. This would lead to an increase the use of consensus as tool for political interaction rather than power. As Warren (1992) states, democracy is necessary to the values of self-development, autonomy, and self-governance (8).</p><h3>Analysis and Criticism</h3><p>There are some limitations in outcomes that are representative of ‘public’ opinion for policy making. Democs main emphasis on grass-roots organisation might have drawbacks. The most successful events were run by members of the community or voluntary sector which offers new ways of public engagement through civil society rather than traditional ways through formal political processes. However, unless Democs is played under a national program when a large enough number of games have been played, it does not allow sample the population in order to achieve representation of result.</p><p>Furthermore, voluntary participation might not always produce full data to include into the the overall data under national program (Bruce,2010).There was some difficulty with attracting citizens for playing Democs on more complex subjects such as synthetic biology as more groups of scientists took part, hence there is possible need of leadership through community centres or other organisations to reach citizens. Democs is better suited for grass roots organisations to create their own consensus which can be an incentive for action or to create an opportunity for development of shared co-ordination with other organisations. Democs would benefit from providing more information on follow-up action, debriefings, or be used by activist organisations in order to create support for possible action.</p><p>Despite being less resource consuming, Democs is time consuming to develop despite this, hence it would not be suitable for deliberation of urgent issues for community groups or policy makers.</p><p>Democs has the possibility to have a significant impact on policy making under a large national programme, as it would be more representative. As for grass-roots organisations Democs has an educational value as the response of participants shows, that deliberation through Democs has the potential to help groups to develop a shared understanding of issues that can offer a platform for communal action.</p><h3>References</h3><p>Bruce, D., (2010) Playing Democs Game to Explore Synthetic Biology.

"<h3>Definition</h3><p>A Scenario Workshop is a participatory method encouraging local action with a mix of scenario and workshop which aims to solve local problems and anticipate future ones<a href=""///C:/Users/Samantha/Documents/COM%20417%20Assgn%203.docx#_ftn1"" name=""_ftnref1"" title="""" id=""_ftnref1"">[1]{C}{C}{C}</a>. Scenarios involve narrative descriptions of potential future problems that emphasize relationships between events and decision points<a href=""///C:/Users/Samantha/Documents/COM%20417%20Assgn%203.docx#_ftn2"" name=""_ftnref2"" title="""" id=""_ftnref2"">{C}{C}{C}[2]{C}{C}{C}</a>. In addition, scenarios direct attention to causes, areas for development and the span of exigencies that may be met in a local community issue<a href=""///C:/Users/Samantha/Documents/COM%20417%20Assgn%203.docx#_ftn3"" name=""_ftnref3"" title="""" id=""_ftnref3"">2</a>. The workshop is the approach aspect of this method in which participants from a local community engage in discussion, produce some sort of action through deliberative discussion and act as decision-makers or create a communal plan of action. The goal of a Scenario Workshop is to create a dialogue among policy-makers, experts and ordinary citizens around a local and communal matter such as water resources or transportation<a href=""///C:/Users/Samantha/Documents/COM%20417%20Assgn%203.docx#_ftn4"" name=""_ftnref4"" title="""" id=""_ftnref4"">2</a>. The Scenario Workshop is characterized by its ability to create new knowledge surrounding a local, community issue. Additionally, this participatory method is used to gather knowledge about participants’ understandings and visions of a local topic, by looking into their attitudes towards defined scenarios and the basis for those attitudes towards specifically defined scenarios<a href=""///C:/Users/Samantha/Documents/COM%20417%20Assgn%203.docx#_ftn5"" name=""_ftnref5"" title="""" id=""_ftnref5"">1</a>. Scenarios are developed by experts (scientists) and are thoroughly scrutinized by the participants which connects research and social needs<a href=""///C:/Users/Samantha/Documents/COM%20417%20Assgn%203.docx#_ftn6"" name=""_ftnref6"" title="""" id=""_ftnref6"">1</a>. Scenario Workshops involve a group of citizens interacting with other participants to exchange knowledge, experience, develop common visions, debate, provide criticism and produce a plan of community action for potential future developments<a href=""///C:/Users/Samantha/Documents/COM%20417%20Assgn%203.docx#_ftn7"" name=""_ftnref7"" title="""" id=""_ftnref7"">3</a>.  The Scenario Workshop is used so local communities are involved and find solutions to local problems. This method is also utilized by large organizations, such as the United Nations and the European Union to address social and environmental concerns<a href=""///C:/Users/Samantha/Documents/COM%20417%20Assgn%203.docx#_ftn8"" name=""_ftnref8"" title="""" id=""_ftnref8"">1</a>. A Scenario Workshop typically has three stages of involvement which includes: the critical phase, the visionary phase and the implementation phase. During the Scenario Workshop time is allotted for brainstorming, discussion, presentations and voting<a href=""///C:/Users/Samantha/Documents/COM%20417%20Assgn%203.docx#_ftn9"" name=""_ftnref9"" title="""" id=""_ftnref9"">1</a>.  </p><h3 class=""MsoNormal"">Problems and Purpose</h3><p>The purpose of a Scenario Workshop is to provide for direct participation of four social groups from civil society. Participants are given a direct opportunity to exchange and discuss their points of view and make recommendations regarding a particular local, community issue with experts and decision-makers (politicians). Essentially, a Scenario Workshop is a tool encouraging dialogue among ordinary citizens, policy-makers, and experts. As a result, community involvement is produced by managed and facilitated discussions between a number of groups with a mixed composition of participants from the same living area.  Scenario Workshops increase the chance of timely intervention and control of a present or anticipated problem.<a href=""///C:/Users/Samantha/Documents/COM%20417%20Assgn%203.docx#_ftn1"" name=""_ftnref1"" title="""" id=""_ftnref1"">5</a></p><p class=""MsoNormal""></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">The aims of a Scenario Workshop include raising awareness of future problems in a community; helping to develop a common definition of a desirable factor; facilitating discussions between different social groups within a society; examining the differences and similarities, as well as problems and solutions as perceived by the four participating role groups; cultivating steps and solutions for foreseen problems; and stimulating teamwork in coming up with a solutions or recommendations with the ideal result being consensus.<a href=""///C:/Users/Samantha/Documents/COM%20417%20Assgn%203.docx#_ftn2"" name=""_ftnref2"" title="""" id=""_ftnref2"">5</a></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Scenario Workshops are not suitable for narrow issues. Additionally, when there are not enough participants, Scenario Workshops are not useful, because a productive and successful workshop cannot be accomplished. A weakness of Scenario Workshops is that the cost to run them is typically high. Additionally, organizing participants from across the community can be difficult, because it requires a good amount of planning to ensure diversity of participants and a rewarding workshop session.<a href=""///C:/Users/Samantha/Documents/COM%20417%20Assgn%203.docx#_ftn3"" name=""_ftnref3"" title="""" id=""_ftnref3"">1</a></p><h3 class=""MsoNormal"">History</h3><p>The Scenario Workshop derives from the Scandinavian tradition of citizen involvement in which scenarios are developed and presented by experts (scientists) to a group of citizens from a local community in a workshop that lasts two to three days<a href=""///C:/Users/Samantha/Documents/COM%20417%20Assgn%203.docx#_ftn1"" name=""_ftnref1"" title="""" id=""_ftnref1"">8</a>. Since 1993, this participatory method has been used to actively involve and facilitate the process for citizens to develop decisions about technology politics in cities within Denmark<a href=""///C:/Users/Samantha/Documents/COM%20417%20Assgn%203.docx#_ftn2"" name=""_ftnref2"" title="""" id=""_ftnref2"">6</a>. Another objective of the Scenario Workshop was to develop scenarios that relate to sustainable development and urban ecology in the daily life of Danish citizens. Currently, this method is used throughout Europe by large organizations such as the European Union and the United Nations due to its usefulness. A scenario, a derivative of data or models, aids in the input and discussion of local and communal issues.</p><h3 class=""MsoNormal"">Participant Selection</h3><p>The four role groups present within a Scenario Workshop are representatives of the residents (civil society), politicians (decision-makers), representatives of the economy (founders) and experts in the topic at hand<a href=""///C:/Users/Samantha/Documents/COM%20417%20Assgn%203.docx#_ftn1"" name=""_ftnref1"" title="""" id=""_ftnref1"">5</a>. This subdivision is necessary to balance the various interests of the different role groups and to include them on an equal basis. Typically, participants are selected from a group of 25 to 30 local government officials, technical experts, business people and knowledgeable community residents. All participants should have equal footing in and adequate information of the problem in question, as well as the capability of coming up with potential and viable solutions<a href=""///C:/Users/Samantha/Documents/COM%20417%20Assgn%203.docx#_ftn2"" name=""_ftnref2"" title="""" id=""_ftnref2"">5</a>. Members within the scenario team are asked to have open minds and the ability to work within a team atmosphere<a href=""///C:/Users/Samantha/Documents/COM%20417%20Assgn%203.docx#_ftn3"" name=""_ftnref3"" title="""" id=""_ftnref3"">2</a>. Participants are chosen on the basis of their stake in the issue at hand<a href=""///C:/Users/Samantha/Documents/COM%20417%20Assgn%203.docx#_ftn4"" name=""_ftnref4"" title="""" id=""_ftnref4"">4</a>. The number of role groups and participants within a Scenario Workshop varies depending on the severity and size of the issue.</p><p class=""MsoNormal""></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">The selection of participants is a major part of a successful Scenario Workshop. Choosing and contacting the participants is very time-consuming. When selecting participants one must consider the regional structure of a society and be knowledgeable about the key players that concern the topic of the workshops. Organization of participants within a workshop could start several months in advance in order to conduct a thorough and successful workshop. Many of the participants, already grouped into the four role groups, are chosen based on the topic of the workshop. <a href=""///C:/Users/Samantha/Documents/COM%20417%20Assgn%203.docx#_ftn5"" name=""_ftnref5"" title="""" id=""_ftnref5"">7</a></p><h3 id=""ftn5"">Deliberation, Decisions, and Public Interaction</h3><p>Experts, or facilitators with extensive knowledge on the Workshop topic, present the Scenario Workshop four stories, or visions, to match the participants’ focus with their responsibility.  After the Scenario Workshop experts present the four visions to the Workshop as a whole, participants are then divided into four scenario groups each of which analyzes one of the four visions that was presented by the Workshop experts. Each of the four groups elects a representative member within their small group to present the undeveloped vision of their respective group. Within the groups, the Scenario Workshop experts ask all participants to discuss and deliberate on their delegated vision, as well as be critical of all other visions analyzed by the other groups.</p><p class=""MsoNormal""></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">The four divided groups work towards developing a precise vision statement that their elected representative member will announce to the Scenario Workshop as a whole when coming back together. After the four small group visions are presented by each groups’ elected representative, a “common vision” is created. The “common vision” serves as the starting point for the generation of ideas. All participants of the Workshop are asked to develop four topics from the “common vision.” Once this is accomplished, participants are then divided into four thematic groups. Each of the four thematic groups discuss one of the four themes that emerged from the “common vision.” Each participant within their thematic group will provide, in one sentence, a brief idea/action on the respective theme they talked about as a group. Participants who gave an idea/action regarding their small group theme are asked to go more in-depth about their response in order to develop their response more concretely. Participants then vote on the three best responses to present to the Workshop as a whole. A number of ideas are produced from all thematic groups.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">After the presentation of all thematic groups’ idea/actions, the Scenario Workshop collectively votes once more on the best ideas/actions in order to narrow down the selection even further. Next, a standard Scenario Workshop evaluation questionnaire is given to all Scenario Workshop participants to determine whether they agree or disagree with the vision statements that were made. Additionally, the questionnaire includes open-ended questions for participants to evaluate the quality of the Workshop overall. Participants are provided one hour to evaluate anonymously. Insights will be drawn from the questionnaire responses.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Conclusions and recommendations from the Scenario Workshop are used by politicians for debate, regulation and are accepted as the input or “the voice of the people.” Therefore, the participant selection process of the Scenario Workshop is crucial. The Scenario Workshop topic is communicated as a local issue that cannot be resolved without the participation of local people and the Workshop is designed to find solutions to those local problems. The design of scenarios is a crucial challenge in the Scenario Workshops. The results are used to make better and long-term solutions to problems that affect many community actors involved. Workshop discussions remain confidential until experts or facilitators of a Scenario Workshop make them publicly available through various media outlets.<a href=""///C:/Users/Samantha/Documents/COM%20417%20Assgn%203.docx#_ftn1"" name=""_ftnref1"" title="""" id=""_ftnref1"">9</a></p><h3 id=""ftn1"">Influence, Outcomes, and Effects</h3><p>Scenario Workshops initiate citizen dialogue, create improved interaction between the four societal role groups and provide opportunities for citizens’ input on decision-making in the political arena. The results of the Scenario Workshop play an important role in local debate on issues impacting the community. Additionally, successful Scenario Workshops empower citizens to get involved in the early stages of designing a plan or an issue. Evaluation of Scenario Workshop participants following a project demonstrates that it functions as an important learning experience and paves the way from better dialogue at a local level. The results of a Scenario Workshop are mutual collective efforts that contribute to developing realistic strategies for the topic at hand. Scenarios Workshop findings are taken into account by decision-makers when considering potential effects on future scenarios.<a href=""///C:/Users/Samantha/Documents/COM%20417%20Assgn%203.docx#_ftn1"" name=""_ftnref1"" title="""" id=""_ftnref1"">10</a> However, long-term changes in communities have not been checked or evaluated.<a href=""///C:/Users/Samantha/Documents/COM%20417%20Assgn%203.docx#_ftn2"" name=""_ftnref2"" title="""" id=""_ftnref2"">10</a></p><h3 id=""ftn2"">Analysis and Criticism</h3><p>Although Scenario Workshops are helpful in integrating citizen-input into local community decision-making, some of the pitfalls or limitations of Scenario Workshops include the ‘Zeitgeist’ problem in which group dynamics can affect the outcome of the deliberative process. For instance, different exercises will have similar results. The ‘opacity of context’ is another issue confronted by scenario workshops when participants become focused on particular aspects of a certain sector, such as technology, but do not fully evaluate the social, economic and political implications of the associated sector changes. The ‘event evaluation’ is another issue faced by this method in which people have the tendency to overestimate the probability of likely events.<a href=""///C:/Users/Samantha/Documents/COM%20417%20Assgn%203.docx#_ftn1"" name=""_ftnref1"" title="""" id=""_ftnref1"">2</a></p><h3 id=""ftn1"">Secondary Sources</h3><ol><li class=""MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst""><a href=""http://www.peopleandparticipation.net/display/Methods/Scenario+Workshop""><u>http://www.peopleandparticipation.net/display/Methods/Scenario+Workshop</u></a> </li><li class=""MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle""><a href=""http://archive.unu.edu/hq/library/Collection/PDF_files/CRIS/PMT.pdf"" target=""_blank""><u>http://archive.unu.edu/hq/library/Collection/PDF_files/CRIS/PMT.pdf</u></a> </li><li class=""MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle""><a href=""http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/beech/spp/1999/00000026/00000005/art00006"" target=""_blank""><u>http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/beech/spp/1999/00000026/00000005/art00006</u></a></li><li class=""MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle""><a href=""http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=tt_xdbMVbhcC&oi=fnd&pg=PA1&dq=scenario+workshop+selecting+participants&ots=bJ5j-i02d9&sig=AShrm99M0w3sWlVC8skCNHFgI5Q#v=onepage&q&f=false""><u>http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=tt_xdbMVbhcC&oi=fnd&pg=PA1&dq=scenario+workshop+selecting+participants&ots=bJ5j-i02d9&sig=AShrm99M0w3sWlVC8skCNHFgI5Q#v=onepage&q&f=false</u></a> </li><li class=""MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle""><a href=""http://www.uibk.ac.at/fbi/download/fbibuchweb1.pdf""><u>http://www.uibk.ac.at/fbi/download/fbibuchweb1.pdf</u></a> </li><li class=""MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle""><a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=zW4eJp5c6CYC&pg=PA116&lpg=PA116&dq=scenario+workshops+history&source=bl&ots=Y_TfaNvN4x&sig=c-_VZ_3EZbfNEYo92jg5fskC4Vg&hl=en&sa=X&ei=SBVLT5uRI8OliQKy9u3aDQ&ved=0CFAQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=scenario%20workshops%20history&f=false""><u>http://books.google.com/books?id=zW4eJp5c6CYC&pg=PA116&lpg=PA116&dq=scenario+workshops+history&source=bl&ots=Y_TfaNvN4x&sig=c-_VZ_3EZbfNEYo92jg5fskC4Vg&hl=en&sa=X&ei=SBVLT5uRI8OliQKy9u3aDQ&ved=0CFAQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=scenario20workshops%20history&f=false</u></a> </li><li class=""MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle""><a href=""http://members.chello.at/wilawien/interacts/interacts_toolkit.pdf""><u>http://members.chello.at/wilawien/interacts/interacts_toolkit.pdf</u></a> </li><li class=""MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle""><a href=""http://www.cipast.org/cipast.php?section=1012""><u>http://www.cipast.org/cipast.php?section=1012</u></a> </li><li class=""MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle""><a href=""http://www.pantaneto.co.uk/issue6/andersenjaeger.htm""><u>http://www.pantaneto.co.uk/issue6/andersenjaeger.htm</u></a></li><li class=""MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle""><a href=""http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=5CN7XRfD-FIC&oi=fnd&pg=PA53&dq=scenario+workshop&ots=M80G-5EdoT&sig=zahAwuyamSJ2O6rL196DR_8cDhQ#v=onepage&q=scenario%20workshop&f=false"" target=""_blank""><u>http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=5CN7XRfD-FIC&oi=fnd&pg=PA53&dq=scenario+workshop&ots=M80G-5EdoT&sig=zahAwuyamSJ2O6rL196DR_8cDhQ#v=onepage&q=scenario%20workshop&f=false</u></a></li></ol><h3>External Links</h3><ol><li>Overview of Scenario Workshop: <u><a href=""http://www.ivm.vu.nl/en/Images/SC6_tcm53-161521.pdf"">http://www.ivm.vu.nl/en/Images/SC6_tcm53-161521.pdf</a></u></li><li>How to develop scenarios slideshow: <u><a href=""http://www.slideshare.net/adgo/scenario-building-workshop-how-to-build-and-use-scenarios"">http://www.slideshare.net/adgo/scenario-building-workshop-how-to-build-a...</a></u></li><li>Tool-kit for Scenario Workshop: <a href=""http://www.uibk.ac.at/fbi/download/fbibuchweb1.pdf""><u>http://www.uibk.ac.at/fbi/download/fbibuchweb1.pdf</u></a></li></ol><h3>Notes</h3><p>Scenario Workshop Case Studies:</p><p class=""MsoNormal""></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Street, P.

"<h3><strong>Definition</strong></h3><p>Model UN is a simulation of the United Nations that aims to reach students from all walks of life by educating them about international political issues within the United Nations<a href=""#_ftn1"" name=""_ftnref1"" title="""" id=""_ftnref1"">[1]</a>. The Model UN encourages students to act as leaders and ambassadors of a nation within a particular UN member states. The students play the role of an ambassador and are encouraged to gain knowledge of a current issue set on the UN agenda. There, they are able to discuss and debate political issues through the deliberative forum designed by the Model UN. The student participants are given the responsibilities of a delegate and diplomats where they are obligated to create speeches, outline paper drafts, debate, deliberate, consult with one another and further negotiate with their member states to resolve and develop solutions to a political issues set on the agenda. The students represent either a nation, or an NGO in a simulated session of a UN committee, such as the Security Council or the General Assembly.</p><h3><strong>History</strong></h3><p>In the early 1920’s, students from the United States participated in collegiate simulations of the League of Nations, the predecessor to the United Nations.<a href=""#_ftn2"" name=""_ftnref2"" title="""" id=""_ftnref2"">[2]</a> For example National Model United Nations and the Harvard Model United Nation have started simulations of the League of Nation during the 1920’s. <a href=""#_ftn3"" name=""_ftnref3"" title="""" id=""_ftnref3"">[3]</a> The Model UN began as the Model League of Nations Assembly, in the early 1930’s. This Model employed similar simulations to the League of Nations. In 1945, the League of Nations was dismantled and the United Nations was created. In 1947 the League of Nations and the Model League of Nations Assembly made a decision to combine their efforts to transition to a new organization that would later be named the Model United Nations<a href=""#_ftn4"" name=""_ftnref4"" title="""" id=""_ftnref4"">[4]</a>.  The Model UN has traditionally always been a collegiate driven organization, but in 1968 it was expanded for high school students. The high school level of MUN was established to enhance high school student’s participation when it comes to negotiation and oratory skills, and to also broaden their understanding and knowledge of the world.</p><p>The Model of UN simulation was designed to be the exact same as the United Nations. The simulations are divided among the different organs of the United Nations, such as the General Assembly which is the main deliberative assembly, the Security Council for deciding the certain resolutions for peace and security, the Economic and Social Council for encouraging and promoting international and social cooperation and advance development, the Secretariat for providing information needed by the UN, and the International Court of Justice, which is the main judicial organ of the United Nations. Through these five bodies, student delegates are able to hold mock conferences and regular meetings. During this simulation exercises, students are expected to employ a wide variety of communication and critical thinking. They are obligated to employ great skills, such as writing, communication skills, leadership skills, and team work skills that they can apply to their future lives.</p><p>Recently simulation of other deliberative bodies, such as the Global Model United Nations, National Model United Nations, United Nations Youth Association, and Regional Conference has been added in the Model UN.</p><h3><strong>Purpose and Problems  </strong></h3><p>Through the Global Model United Nations conference, students are encouraged to participate from every region of the world, to act as diplomats and participate in simulated sessions of the United Nations General Assembly and other multilateral bodes In the UN system. The GMUN is delivers three principles embedded within their organization which differ from the Model UN. For example they offer the rules of procedure that offers closer look at how the United Nations actually functions. It offers unlimited access to UN official and diplomats before and during the conference. It also encourages diversity by giving students from different countries an opportunity to participate in the simulation exercises<a href=""#_ftn5"" name=""_ftnref5"" title="""" id=""_ftnref5"">[5]</a>.</p><p>The National Model United Nations is a non-profit organization that aims at educating the student public of the United Nations and its political international issues. This organization’s main purpose is to actively engage students and to mold them to be more of effective global citizens. They aim to build strong leaders that are able to collaborate and deliberate about contemporary issues that plagues the world. They strive to develop “a world comprised of civically engaged people who are aim to create peaceful, multi-lateral conflict resolution and equitable, sustainable human development”<a href=""#_ftn6"" name=""_ftnref6"" title="""" id=""_ftnref6"">[6]</a>.</p><p>The United Nations Association of the United States is also a non-profit organization that aims to promote and encourage the principles set within the United Nations Charter and the effective work performed within the United Nations among their national civil society<a href=""#_ftn7"" name=""_ftnref7"" title="""" id=""_ftnref7"">[7]</a>.</p><p>The essential purpose of the Model UN is to provide an interactive educational experience that teaches students essentially about the United Nations. The simulations offer a detailed experience and understanding of how the process of international debate, negotiation and diplomacy operates. Model UN is very significant in producing well informed global citizens. The simulation of the diplomatic process is very significant in our world, where societies are quickly becoming more interdependent. Therefore, Model UN makes for informed global citizens who not only understand the decisions their nations makes but also how those changes effect politics nationally, regionally, and globally.</p><p>The Model UN aims to solve conflicts, and issues set originally on the United Nations agenda. The students or “delegates” prepare to draft resolutions, plot strategy, negotiate with supporters and adversaries, and resolve conflicts that affect almost every country in the world, all in the interest of mobilizing international cooperation. Model UN ambassador learn how the international community acts on its concerns about peace and security, human rights, the environment, food and hunger, economic development, globalization, and other issues that plagues our societies today. Model UN ambassadors are obligated to discuss these issues in an effective deliberative manner and try to solve these issues through debates and negotiations. </p><h3><strong>Participant Selection</strong></h3><p>As the program is not owned by a particular organization, students and non-profit organizations drive the organization. Model UN exercises are generally open to all students who show interest in participating. The Model UN is a learning process; it does not require participants to demonstrate extensive experience in international relations prior to the conference. A Model UN simulation can be practiced on various levels, in classrooms, school clubs, state-wide, national and international conferences. <a href=""http://www.unausa.org/modelunfaq#Participates_MUN"">[7]</a> The selection process and prerequisites may vary depending on the level, formality and size of the Model UN exercise. A club simulation of the Model UN may select their participants through recruitment, while a conference initiated by a non-profit organization may select through application submission.<br /><br />There are various roles in a Model UN simulation such as delegates, Secretary- Generals, committee staffs, committee chairs and press corp. <a href=""http://www.asiapacificmun.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=18&Itemid=125"">[8]</a> Participants can decide what role to take on or may apply to perform specific roles. Prior to the simulation, participants would complete the necessary preparation work for their role and country of representation..<br /><br />Some high schools and universities offer Model UN as a semester long course. In these cases, students who wish to participate in the exercise can register and enroll at their home institution. For example, <a href=""http://www.chapman.edu/"">Chapman University i</a>n California offers an MUN course that focuses on learning about the United Nations, international diplomacy and breaking international issues. <a href=""http://www.chapman.edu/wilkinson/peacestudies/modelUN.asp"">[9]</a><br /><br />In addition, Model UN conferences can incorporate competitions into the simulation exercise, both on the high school level and collegiate level. Awards are given for specific aspects of the deliberations, such as  “best delegation”, “best large delegation” presented at the <a href=""http://www.hnmun.org/"">Harvard National Model United Nations </a>conference. <a href=""http://www.harvardmun.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Awards-Spreadsheet-1.pdf"">[10]</a> To participate in larger scale conferences and international conferences (e.g. <a href=""http://amunc.net/"">Asia-Pacific Model United Nations </a>Conference), <a href=""http://amunc.net/home/about/conference/"">[11]</a> delegation teams from institutions are required to register with the hosting institution or organization.<br /><br />The <a href=""http://www.unausa.org/Page.aspx?pid=220"">UNA-USA </a>is a respective international Model UN organization; its Global Classroom International Model UN program demonstrates a rigorous participant selection process. <a href=""http://www.unausa.org/Page.aspx?pid=579"">[12]</a> It requires applicants to familiarize with the requirement of the position by providing an overview of the qualifications. The application asks for leadership experiences with the Model UN and a list of short answer questions. After applications are received by the organization, students would be scheduled for an interview to determine acceptance.</p><h3>Deliberation, Decisions, and Public Interaction</h3><p>Deliberation in a Model UN simulation takes place in various committees within the organization. The general committees most often include the General Assembly, Economic and Social Council & Regional Bodies, and the Specialized Agencies. The discussion topics for each committee are chosen by the host institution, which generally includes issues that are currently being discussed in the United Nations.<a href=""http://www.harvardmun.org/committees"">[13]</a> A member state is usually represented by one delegate in each council, though exception to the number of delegate representation can be granted by the host. Prior to the simulation, delegates are expected to have conducted a thorough research on their respective countries and a write a position paper regarding their stance to the topic.<br /><br />A basic flow of the deliberation process in a Model UN simulation could be:</p><p>1. Agenda Setting</p><p>2. Debate & Caucus</p><p>3. Working Papers</p><p>4. Debate & Caucus</p><p>5. Draft Resolutions</p><p>6. Amendments</p><p>7. Vote on Draft</p><p>8. Final Resolutions<a href=""http://www.worldmun.org/upload/WorldMUN_101.pdf"">[14]</a><br /><br />The Model UN simulation utilizes Rules of Procedure to facilitate and regulate deliberation. It may include general rules such as the usage of official language, authority of each role, and delegate conduct. Rules of Procedure also contain the rules governing debate, for example, the debate agenda, the caucus and the appeal proceedings. During the deliberative sessions, committee chairs act as moderators. In some simulations, the chair would prepare a speakers’ list to ensure equal speaking opportunity. In others, delegates would simply raise their placards to acquire a speaking time. However, delegates are almost always responsible to only speak at the chair’s discretion.<br /><br />Caucusing in the Model UN simulation are conducted both formally and informally. To open a debate, each delegate takes a turn to address their position on the chosen issue. The delegates split into those who support and those who oppose a specific position and are allocated equal speaking time. In between the sessions, informal small group discussion present an opportunity for delegates to assemble and work out differences and resolutions.<a href=""http://www.amun.org/index.php?page=UNandMUN-diffs"">[15]</a></p><p>Throughout the sessions, delegates keep a working paper that includes proposals regarding problems with the topic at hand. These working papers can be shared between delegates with the Chair’s approval. This process aids the committee in keeping clear records of new ideas and proposals. Proposals eventually accumulate into more concrete statements and are rewritten into comprehensive resolutions. A number of draft resolutions then go through committees for voting. Each member state has one vote, either voting “yes”, “no”, or “abstention,” Though in the <a href=""http://www.un.org/Docs/sc/"">Security Council</a>, simulating the<a href=""http://www.un.org/en/""> UN</a>, one “no” from any permanent member would veto the draft resolution. A draft resolution must be passed through majority voting before it becomes the final resolution.</p><p> </p><h3>Influence, Outcomes, and Effects</h3><p>Since Model United Nations is an academic stimulation to educate students, both the outcome and effect focus on the way young people have grown and developed in terms of participation.</p><p>Public officials in national and international governments/organizations have called for voices from young people in a <a href=""http://www.un.org/gmun/"">Global Model United Nations </a>conference. <a href=""http://www.un.org/sg/biography.shtml"">Ban Ki-moon</a>, Secretary-General of <a href=""http://www.dfat.gov.au/geo/rok/index.html"">Republic of Korea</a> and <a href=""http://www.un.org/wcm/content/site/chronicle/home/articlesbyauthor/ae/kiyoakasaka"">Kiyo Akasaka</a>, <a href=""http://www.un.org/en/"">United Nations </a><a href=""http://unic.un.org/aroundworld/unics/en/whoWeAre/aboutDPI/USG/index.asp"">Secretary-General for Communication and Public Information</a> stated they would like to hear young voices in particular <a href=""http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2011/pi1997.doc.htm""><u>[16]</u></a> because young people are the leaders of the future world. With the encouragement of public figures, more and more are students urged to participate in Model UN conferences. Through the conferences, students learn to appreciate and respect the views of different countries with diverse cultural backgrounds, have a better understanding of UN structures, and acknowledge the importance of cooperation from every country to deal with global affairs <a href=""http://uca.edu/politicalscience/student-activities/amun/""><u>[17]</u></a>. Student participants have even attempted to sway decision-making. For example, young participates in <a href=""http://www.nigmuns.org/"">Nigeria Model UN</a> conferences became young diplomats who attempt to influence the world diplomacy, and they wrote articles, reports, and newsletters aimed at increasing awareness and ensuring the voices are heard through different media outlets globally. <a href=""http://groups.tigweb.org/nmun""><u>[18]</u></a></p><p>The Model United Nations conferences mainly concentrate on debating international politics and law, which continues to impact delegates’ real life. Some participants become more and more interested in law and policies after gaining essential leadership and problem-solving skills during these conferences. The experience inspires students “toward deeper study of international relations and law and preparation for a career that promotes international understanding and common growth <a href=""http://www.stanleyfoundation.org/articles.cfm?id=698""><u>[19]</u></a>.” Many public figures such as <a href=""http://www.supremecourt.gov/"">U.S. Supreme Court </a>Justice <a href=""http://www.supremecourt.gov/about/biographies.aspx"">Stephen Breyer</a>, former <a href=""http://www.icj-cij.org/homepage/index.php"">World Court </a>Justice <a href=""http://www.iaiparis.com/profile/stephen.schwebel"">Stephen M. Schwebel</a>, <a href=""http://www.un.org/en/"">United Nations </a>Secretary-General and actor <a href=""http://www.biography.com/people/samuel-l-jackson-9542182"">Samuel Jackson</a> are former Model UN participants <a href=""http://cyberschoolbus.un.org/modelun/faq.html""><u>[20]</u></a>.</p><p> </p><h3>Analysis and Criticism</h3><p>Though the Model United Nations was intended to educate students about world affairs and get them engaged in the deliberative process, funding problems, fee abuse and criticism begin to rise. The Model United Nations receive financial support from international and national governments, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and private organizations; however, they face fundraising deficiencies and budget cuts due the economic downturn in recent years. And some are concerned that financial problems will result in less deliberation. For example, according to Model UN Headquarter of Cyberschoolbus, every delegate is required to pay a fee ranging from $15 to $165 upon participation in Model UN conferences that are held in hotels and colleges; however, the fee does not include rooms, food and transportation <a href=""http://cyberschoolbus.un.org/modelun/faq.html""><u>[20]</u></a>. A lot of delegates attempt to receive funds from school, scholarship, local organizations; however, they get very limited funds. Potential delegates are then excluded from participation if they do not receive enough funds. <a href=""http://www.mdc.edu/north/"">Miami Dade College’s North Campus </a>has been one of the constant participants at the National Model United Nations conferences in New York City since 1992 and there were 24 delegates attending in 2010 <a href=""http://www.mdc.edu/main/falcontimes/archive/vol47-14/news/funding_cut_model_un_fundraises.asp""><u>[21]</u></a>. Unfortunately, there were only 11 delegates, half of 2010, going to the conference last year (2011) because the College Provost cut Model UN funding based on school budget cuts <a href=""http://www.mdc.edu/main/falcontimes/archive/vol47-14/news/funding_cut_model_un_fundraises.asp""><u>[21]</u></a>. Those delegates attempted to raise funds by selling pizzas and sent letters to request sponsorship from different companies <a href=""http://www.mdc.edu/main/falcontimes/archive/vol47-14/news/funding_cut_model_un_fundraises.asp""><u>[21]</u></a>.</p><p>Besides encountering funding problems, the Model United Nations faces some criticism. Critics asked whether it was efficient, reasonable and necessary for student groups to spend so much money on Model UN conferences; however, only one piece of news reported fee abuse. The Model UN’s student groups at the <a href=""http://www.wisc.edu/"">University of Wisconsin-Madison </a>requested 133 percent more than the Pre-Law Society’s student groups for the same event <a href=""http://badgerherald.com/oped/2001/11/13/model_un_a_model_seg.php""><u>[22]</u></a>. As a result, Model UN got $1000 and Pre-Law Society only got $300 <a href=""http://badgerherald.com/oped/2001/11/13/model_un_a_model_seg.php""><u>[22]</u></a>. It was unreasonable that Model UN got three times more funds than Pre-Law Society while they did not have three times more members than Pre-Law Society. This “special treatment” resulted in that critics suspected the Model UN’s student group at the <a href=""http://www.wisc.edu/"">UW-Madison </a>as a segregated fee abuser <a href=""http://badgerherald.com/oped/2001/11/13/model_un_a_model_seg.php""><u>[22]</u></a>.</p><p>Other critics mainly focus on how Model United Nations conferences will actually impact the deliberation process in reality after spending a large amount of money. “As none of the delegates truly represent the countries they are fighting for in the Model United Nations conferences, it is always possible to be reasonable, deliberate, and forward-looking <a href=""http://hpronline.org/specialty-blogs/hprgument-blog/harvard-model-un-self-congratulations-or-a-glimpse-of-how-the-world-could-be-run/""><u>[23]</u></a>.” Hence, it is easier for delegates to come up with better solutions and reach more important compromise than real political actors in the world <a href=""http://hpronline.org/specialty-blogs/hprgument-blog/harvard-model-un-self-congratulations-or-a-glimpse-of-how-the-world-could-be-run/""><u>[23]</u></a>. In spite of that Model UN is not real, it is less likely its decision will affect the real deliberation process <a href=""http://hpronline.org/specialty-blogs/hprgument-blog/harvard-model-un-self-congratulations-or-a-glimpse-of-how-the-world-could-be-run/""><u>[23]</u></a>.</p><p>While delegates are struggling with fundings, some Model United Nations conferences offer best/outstanding delegate award in order to encourage more  competiton and repay students' hard work <a href=""http://bestdelegate.com/high-school-model-un-rankings-2011-2012-purpose-philosophy-and-methodology/"">[24]</a>. Nonetheless, participations is more important than competition. Some people worry about that awards will be ""the sole purpose of attending a Model UN conferences"" <a href=""http://www.unausa.org/modelun/conferenceplanning/substantiveinformation#awardsorexpectationsforperformance"">[25]</a> for students.</p><h3>Secondary Sources</h3><ul><li><a href=""http://www.unausa.org/modelunfaq#What_is_MUN"">[<u>1</u>]</a><a href=""http://www.unausa.org/modelunfaq#What_is_MUN"">What is Model United Nations?</a> <a href=""http://www.unausa.org/Page.aspx?pid=220"">United Nations Association of the United States of America</a></li><li><a href=""http://www.unausa.org/modelunfaq#What_is_MUN"">[2]</a> <a href=""http://www.unausa.org/Page.aspx?pid=220"">United Nations Association of the United States of America</a></li><li><a href=""http://www.munfw.org/archive/history.htm"">[3]</a> <a href=""http://www.munfw.org/archive/history.htm"">MUNFW History</a>. <a href=""http://www.munfw.org/index.htm"">Model United Nations of the Far West</a>.</li><li><a href=""http://liberalarts.iupui.edu/modelun/about"">[4]</a> <a href=""http://liberalarts.iupui.edu/modelun/about"">About Us</a>. <a href=""http://liberalarts.iupui.edu/modelun/"">Indianaponis Model United Nations</a>.</li><li>[5] Ripley, Brian, Neal Carter, and Andrea K.

"<h3>Definition</h3><p>Habitat Conservation Planning (HCP) in the U.S. is a plan that prepared under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) by nonfederal parties who want to obtain permits for the incidental taking of threatened and endangered species. They are planning documents that describe the anticipated effects of the proposed take permit. It must also describe how those impacts will be minimized or mitigated and how the HCP is to be funded. They have to ensure that the species will be conserved and that they will contribute to their recovery. Essentially, it aims to balance development and nature preservation. These plans have been multiplying over the past 30 years and over 350 HCPs have now been approved, which affects over one hundred threatened or endangered species populations. HCPs can be applied to be listed and non-listed species. These proposed conservation plans are reviewed by the US Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) or the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) who then may issue an incidental take permit after extensive review.  Problems and Purpose</p><h3>Problems and Purpose</h3><p>The Purpose of HCP is to provide a plan for a project that will provide a safe environment and habitat for an endangered or threatened species who's habitat is otherwise being destroyed by non-federal landowners. It seeks to balance the needs of an endangered or threatened species with the needs of these non-federal landowners so that land development may continue in a way that will not harm the species any further. The incidental taking permit will only be allowed if it is conducted in a manner that will cause the less amount of harm to the species. The steps to ensuring this conservation must be explicitly stated in the HCP in order for the NMFS to issue the permit and allow the plan to move forward.</p><p>One of the problems with the HCP is their No Surprises policy. This policy makes it so that landowners will not be able to accept new land-use restrictions or financial commitments beyond those agreed to in the HCP. This means that if the species does not survive over the term of the permit covered by the HCP, then the agencies have to agree to take full responsibility, including both financial and logistical, for the efforts above that required by the HCP (Peter Aengst, Intro to Habitat Conservation Planning.) This policy especially made environmental groups unhappy. For instance, according to the group, Defenders of Wildlife, this rule prevents HCPs from improving and avoiding species declines. Other problems are that they are not consistent with species recovery, their scientific assessment of the situation is often inadequate, and the public minimally gets the opportunity to provide input for HCPs (Defenders of Wildlife.)  </p><h3>History</h3><p>The Endangered Species Act was implemented in 1973. This act regulates the protection of threatened and endangered species along with their habitat on federal and private property by outlawing the “take” of listed species through direct harm to individuals or through habitat destruction. In 1982, Congress amended Section 10 (a)(1)(B) of the ESA in order to allow private landowners to destroy some endangered species habitat through a permitting system, known as HCPs (Defenders of Wildlife). It arises from both Sections 9 and 10(a) of the ESA. Under Section 9, it states that it is illegal to kill, harm, or harass a listed species. This applies to private and public lands and “has been interpreted broadly to include habitat destruction or modification” (Aengst). This was a problem for private landowners, who’s activities might accidentally harm or kill the listed species on their land, making them subject to criminal and civil penalties (Aengst). So, under Section 10 (a), non-federal landowners who plan activities on their lands that may 'incidentally take' a threatened or endangered species may apply to FWS or NMFS for an incidental take permit that exempts them from this strict Section 9 prohibition against take.</p><p>Section 10(a) was initially created by Congress in order to allow exemption by proponents of a conservation plan on San Bruno Mountain, California, made up in the early 80s (Aegnst). Congress stated in a conference report that this plan intended to act “as a model” for future conservation plans under this exemption. This plan was ultimately based on “an independent exhaustive biological study” and “protected at least 875 of the habitat of the listed butterflies and led to the development of enough land to allow for enhancement of the survival of the species” according to Congress (H.R. Rep. No. 835, 97th Cong., 2nd Sess. 32, 1982. p.32).</p><p>Conservation acts before HCPs have been attempted. Some examples of important U.S. conservation act's include, the Yellowstone Park Protection Act of 1872, the National Park Organic Act of 1916, and the Migratory Bird Treaty with Canada in 1916 then with Mexico in 1936 (Reed F. Noss, “The Science of Conservation Planning, 22.) However, all of these measures were regulatory and prohibitory and parks like Yellowstone were mostly preserved for their geography rather than its biology (Noss, 22).  </p><h3>Participant Selection</h3><p>In order to be a participant in HCPs and obtain an incidental take permit, the party or organization must follow certain regulations and comply with a Five Points Policy. Once reviewing the plan, it is the FWS regional director who decides whether an incidental take permit will be issued, based on whether the HCP meets the criteria and addresses the aforementioned requirements as well as other applicable laws (FWS).</p><p>Regulations required in the HCPs are listed in Section 10 of the Act. They need to include an assessment of impacts that are likely to result from the proposed taking of one or more species. Then there needs to be a list of measures that the permit applicant will take on in order to monitor, minimize and mitigate for the said impacts, and also mention the way that they will fund these measures. They also need to provide the procedures for how to deal with unforeseen circumstances. After, they are required to list some alternative actions they could have taken, then give a reason or reasons as to why the applicant decided not to partake in those alternative actions. Lastly, they must comply with any other additional measures that FWS may require, (FWS).</p><p>As mentioned before, the HCPs must also comply with the Five Points Policy (FWS.) The first of these polices is defining the expected biological outcome for each species covered in their HCP. Second, there needs to be adaptive management, which entails “methods for addressing uncertainty and also monitoring and feedback to biological goals and objectives” (FWS). Third, it is required to monitor for compliance, effectiveness, and effects. Fourth, there is a duration for the permit which will be determined by the time-span of the project and will be provided, as decided by FWS, to give enough adequate time to achieve biological goals. Lastly, HCPs must comply with public participation according to the National Environmental Policy Act.</p><p>For issuance, the FWS must take all of this into account, as well as the size, duration, and species covered in the HCP. The <u>Federal Registerer</u> will announce the issuance of a permit. Then the permittee and anyone else involved will implement the HCP as well as its monitoring and funding components.  </p><h3>Deliberation, Decisions, and Public Interaction</h3><p>Decisions that concern matters of public trust, such as wildlife protection, must allow public involvement (A Citizen's Guide to Habitat Conservation Plans.) The public often have a bigger interest in the impact of large multi-species plans that could “damage surrounding communities through a loss of species diversity and open space” (A Citizen's Guide to Habitat Conservation Plans,) thus making public oversight of plan development important and critical. It also helps to make sure that conflicts of interest do not result in a “disservice to the public interest in wildlife protection” (A Citizen's Guide to Habitat Conservation Plans.) This inclusion assures that citizens will be heard on issues that could change the landscape of their communities, especially if public funding is part of the plan. While this is an attempt at deliberation, the purpose of public outreach is so that the plan will be more likely to go through rather than outvoted against. However, the citizens are allowed to sue the federal government for enforcement of the Act.</p><p>Ultimately, little public participation is required, by law, in the development of HCPs. The FWS or NMFS does, however, have to publish a notice in the <u>Federal Register</u> whenever a formal application for an Incidental Take Permit is made and upon that, the public is given 30 days to submit comments. These comments often have little impact since under Section 10, the Services do not have to respond to them or even consider them in the final making decision. </p><p>In addition, when the permit applicant is a public entity, state or local law requires more public access. For example, in California, there is a state law for governmental HCP applicants that requires them to allow public access to all meetings that involves a public decision making body, such as city council (A Citizen's Guide to Habitat Conservation Plans.) </p><h3>Influence, Outcomes, and Effects</h3><p>The result of HCPs may have many potential benefits in conserving threatened and endangered species. For instance, they can aim their focus on multi-species and habitat managements, rather than single species. It can also help “engage private landowners and local governments in conservation planning, protect unlisted species, and promote long-term conservation of species and habitats through protection and management” (Defenders of Wildlife.) </p><p>Some effects have been positive while others have been negative. Some HCPs that have been approved have contributed to loss of habitat which poses huge risks for species survival, according to Defenders of Wildlife. If not adequately assessed, HCPs can further threaten a species rather than protect them. </p><p>Some HCPs have been successful in their aims of conservation, however. An example of one is the Coachella Valley HCP near Palm Springs, California, implemented in 1986. After a rise of rapid housing development on private land in the California desert, the habitat of the Coachella Valley fringe toed lizard was increasingly threatened (Aengst). This HCP was designed to allow the housing development to continue all while key portions of the lizard's habitat was still protected. They were able to establish three reserves, resulting in 17,000 acres, 8,000 acres of which is occupiable lizard habitat (Aegnst). They were able to get funds for this from The Nature Conservancy, the Federal Land and Water Conservation Fund, and other sources. </p><p>Another example of an HCP outcome was in 2006 when Benton County, Oregon, received a grant from FWS to develop an HCP in order to expand upon current conservation efforts by increasing restoration opportunities, providing long-term protection of sensitive species and habitats, and developing a more economical and ecological approach to species conservation and mitigation, according to the Benton County Natural Areas and Parks Department. </p><p>In the 1990s, the Clinton Administration made changes in its ESA policies that has increased the “incentive for landowners to engage in the HCP planning process” (Aegnst.) Since then, increased numbers in the amount of HCPs have been proposed and approved. </p><h3>Analysis and Criticism</h3><p>HCPs on paper can potentially do a lot to help preserve habitats that threatened and endangered species require in order to survive and to thrive. However, there are holes in the way which the FWS goes about addressing unforeseen circumstances once an HCP is implemented. In Section 10 it simply states that regulations require that all HCPs detail the “procedures to be used to deal with Unforeseen Circumstances.” However, under IA, it prohibits the Services from requiring adjustments in the amount of habitat protected under the HCP. This is problem because with many habitats and species, many unforeseeable changes may come about in the future. Something that the Services can do, as suggested by A Citizen's Guide to Habitat Conservation Plans, is to ensure that the proposed strategy be rigorously evaluated, and for the HCP to include provision to monitor its success and adjust it if necessary. </p><p>In addition, the creation of HCPs should encourage more public participation than it currently does. Currently, it is not even technically enforced for a permittee to get citizens involved in their HCP. To make it a more deliberative and democratic process, it is important to highly advertise an open forum whenever an HCP is proposed where citizens, landowners, scientists, biologists, and other experts can attend, much like it is done in California. By making the HCP more deliberative, perhaps it can contribute to the evaluating process and ensure that the FWS makes a wise decision for which HCP they decide to issue. This can both help with an increase in assuring the conservation of a threatened and endangered species and its habitat, as well as rejecting those that just will end up harming them more so than before. </p><h3>Secondary Sources</h3><p>Aengst, Peter, Jeremy Anderson, Jay Chamberlin, Christopher Grunewald, Susan Loucks, Elizabeth Wheatly, and Steven Yaffee.

"<h3>Definition</h3><p>ConsiderIt is an internet-based platform that stems from the basis of personal deliberation into a form of public deliberation. It allows users to examine trade-offs and the vantage points of other users on proposed actions such as ballot measures, by forming deliberation around a list of pro and cons authored, adopted, and shared by various people using the platform. The design process began with the goal of supporting a voters guide written by community members in the 2010 U.S. election. ConsiderIt was deployed in September 2010 as <em>The Living Voter’s Guide </em>(LVG) with nine ballot measures for users to take stances on. ConsiderIt is the first step to developing a more intricate version where citizens can ultimately take more collective action to challenge other problems such as financial reform and climate change. ConsiderIt allows people to not only pull user-created pros and cons into their own “chalkboard” list of pros and cons, but also allows them to author their own points and add to the pool for everyone to read and use in their own lists. The idea of augmenting personal deliberation instead of creating direct discussion is a way of ridding political identity and flaming. ConsiderIt organizes the list of pros and cons into the most popular to least popular based on how often they are used by users with different stances. An important addition to the pro and con list is a slider that is used to display your stance on an issue. Instead of a simple yes or no (oppose vs. support) stance, users use the continuum to show how far they are leaning towards a particular side.</p><h3>Problems and Purpose</h3><p>The ultimate purpose of ConsiderIt is for people to find common ground and inspire public trust among one another. The goal is to bring the “liberal individualist” who values self-expression over listening and the “communitarian” who values group identification, to the same level. Platforms such as Facebook do not encourage a deliberative atmosphere because they don’t push material and content for users to deliberate over. The idea of ConsiderIt fostering deliberation through personal augmentation is its way of not forcing a deliberative ideal, which could result in low participation.  </p><p>With the continuum slider, users can view the most salient pro and con points organized by people with different stances on the issue. These stances are clustered into discrete stance groups on the results browsing page after submission, and show the current breakdown of support for a measure. The interactive bar graph shows seven different stances on the issue and clicking on one of the bars will bring up the most salient list of pros and cons of those who took that stance. ConsiderIt is developed as a more casual interface, which caters to different styles of deliberation. Drawing a pool of more diverse communicators will create a more deliberative atmosphere where users can weigh tradeoffs and listen to what other people have to say about an issue. ConsiderIt’s interface is designed in a way that subtly “nudges” people to include viewpoints of other users. This is illustrated with the pro and con list where an unbalanced list will nudge users to reflect on their own stance and whether or not something else can be included. The users personal deliberation is fostered by forcing users to view both pro and con arguments aligned on both sides of the “chalkboard” in order of popularity.  </p><h3>History</h3><p>ConsiderIt is an open-source platform that gives citizens the ability to work through complex issues and find common ground with one another. It was designed and developed by Travis Kriplean with the assistance of Jonathan Morgan. Deen Freelon from the department of communication, Alan Borning from the department of computer science, and University of Washington Political Science professor, Lance Bennet assisted in the decisions of features and helped the team test the system. The team partnered with Seattle City Club, a nonpartisan civic organization, University of Washington’s Center for Communication & Civic Engagement and its Department of Computer Science and Engineering and with funding from the National Science Foundation. The design team from the University of Washington worked to create a deliberative space in which encapsulated three goals stated by Lance Bennett in a Seattle Times opinion article, “Restoring trust in our neighbors, learning to trust our community's wisdom and demonstrating trust in President Jefferson's claim that an informed citizenry is the bulwark of a democracy”.<a href=""#_ftn1"" name=""_ftnref"" title="""" id=""_ftnref"">1</a> The users have the power to make decisions about their own pros and cons while at the same time making tradeoffs with their peers, ultimately creating a less polarized conversation. So far ConsiderIt has created the Living Voters Guide in Washington State for 2010 and 2011 ballot initiatives. Currently the members of ConsiderIt are working on several other deployments of their site that differ from the Living Voters Guide.</p><p><a href=""#_ftnref"" name=""_ftn1"" title="""" id=""_ftn1"">1</a> Lance Bennitt, Alan Borning, and Diane Douglas, ""New voters guide will heal rifts through voter education and dialogue,"" <em>The Seattle Times</em> (2010), <a href=""http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/opinion/2013012215_guest28douglas.html?prmid=op_ed"">http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/opinion/2013012215_guest28douglas....</a> (accessed February 27, 2012).</p><h3>Participant Selection</h3><p>Participants were drawn mainly through media exposure, such as the Seattle Times, KIRO News, the UW Daily, and the Yakima Herald. The Living Voter’s Guide was also used in several college and high schools classes and further participants were recruited through email lists and social networking sites. Little knowledge of the participants’ political affiliation was discovered due to its open deployment. To prevent the platform from appearing clinical, ConsiderIT did not require or ask people to fill out a profile. Based on metrics of use, users from 134 Washington cities followed the link to the webpage, while 50.4% were from Seattle.<a href=""#_ftn1"" name=""_ftnref"" title="""" id=""_ftnref"">2</a> A separate participant pool was selected for a further in-depth analysis. A week prior to the election, seven residents, ages ranging from 18-47 from Seattle were asked to participate in a lab study with the incentive of receiving a $20 gift certificate. The goal of the lab study was to evaluate the value of the Living Voters Guide, how well participants were able to navigate around the interface, and how participants reacted to other people’s pro and con points.  </p><p><a href=""#_ftnref"" name=""_ftn1"" title="""" id=""_ftn1"">2</a> Travis Kriplean, Jonathan Morgan, Deen Freelon, Allen Borning, and Lance Bennett, ""Supporting Reflective Public Thought with ConsiderIt,"" <em>CSCW 2012: ACM Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work</em> (2012): 6, <a href=""http://dub.washington.edu/djangosite/media/papers/kriplean-cscw2012.pdf"">http://dub.washington.edu/djangosite/media/papers/kriplean-cscw2012.pdf</a> (accessed February 27, 2012).</p><h3>Deliberation, Decisions, and Public Interaction</h3><p>The ConsiderIt platform is used to help individuals sort out their pros and cons of each issue and make decisions on their level of support by reading others pro and con lists. By giving users the option to respond to one another ConsiderIt is opening a place for deliberative democracy on the Internet. Although ConsiderIt is fairly new thousands of users and hundreds of contributors used ConsiderIt’s Living Voters Guide in the five weeks prior to the election.<a href=""#_ftn1"" name=""_ftnref"" title="""" id=""_ftnref"">2</a> Although user interaction was high there are often questions about trustworthiness with platforms like ConsiderIt. This tends to be the case because ConsiderIt only gives the name of the user in hopes to keep any political affiliations separate from the deliberative nature of the platform. Even though the creators of ConsiderIt chose not to include any personal information in the first couple of deployments they have now recommended that additional information be provided “so that users can get a sense of personality and life perspective.”<a href=""#_ftn2"" name=""_ftnref"" title="""" id=""_ftnref"">2</a></p><p><a href=""#_ftnref"" name=""_ftn1"" title="""" id=""_ftn1"">2</a> Travis Kriplean, Jonathan Morgan, Deen Freelon, Allen Borning, and Lance Bennett, ""Supporting Reflective Public Thought with ConsiderIt,"" <em>CSCW 2012: ACM Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work</em> (2012): 2, <a href=""http://dub.washington.edu/djangosite/media/papers/kriplean-cscw2012.pdf"">http://dub.washington.edu/djangosite/media/papers/kriplean-cscw2012.pdf</a> (accessed February 27, 2012).</p><p><a href=""#_ftnref"" name=""_ftn2"" title="""" id=""_ftn2"">2</a> Ibid., 9</p><h3>Influence, Outcomes, and Effects</h3><p>ConsiderIt works to build a greater amount of public trust as well as an information base so that individuals can deliberate and work toward making more informed decisions. By creating more public trust ConsiderIt can work to influence policy measures as they did with the Living Voters Guide as well as encourage media coverage of their forums so more users can be involved in deliberation. The makers of ConsiderIt employed the use of media outlets such as the University of Washington’s periodical, The Daily, The Seattle Times, The Yakima Harold, and KIRO news in Seattle.<a href=""#_ftn1"" name=""_ftnref"" title="""" id=""_ftnref"">2</a> With the help of these news outlets the Living Voters Guide as well as ConsiderIt was able to create a larger user base.</p><p>Although it is difficult to examine whether or not outcomes were shifted due to the ConsiderIt platform there are several sources of data from the Living Voters Guide that suggest that a shift occurred. To begin, the stance sliders were calibrated to log every time users moved their stance slider. The slider was able to show a change in stance by logging 38.3% of the users manipulated the slider before and after posting and looking at other’s pro and con lists. Of this 38.3% of users 47.7% shifted their position by at least one stance group.<a href=""#_ftn2"" name=""_ftnref"" title="""" id=""_ftnref"">2</a> The second data set that showed users of keeping an open mind during the process of deliberation was the switching of positions. Switching positions did not only include becoming more supportive or more resistant to certain issues it also included 54.5% of users flipping sides on an issue after updating.<a href=""#_ftn3"" name=""_ftnref"" title="""" id=""_ftnref"">2</a> Finally, self-reported opinion changes logged from a survey conducted after use showed 46.3% of survey respondents changed their opinion on at least one of the measures.<a href=""#_ftn4"" name=""_ftnref"" title="""" id=""_ftnref"">2</a> This is important to note for the deliberative process because it shows that users are logging on with an open mind and weighing tradeoffs. This goes to show that users are carefully examining an issue and arriving at a well reasoned solution.</p><p><a href=""#_ftnref"" name=""_ftn4"" title="""" id=""_ftn4"">2</a> Travis Kriplean, Jonathan Morgan, Deen Freelon, Allen Borning, and Lance Bennett, ""Supporting Reflective Public Thought with ConsiderIt,"" <em>CSCW 2012: ACM Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work</em> (2012): 6,8 <a href=""http://dub.washington.edu/djangosite/media/papers/kriplean-cscw2012.pdf"">http://dub.washington.edu/djangosite/media/papers/kriplean-cscw2012.pdf</a> (accessed February 27, 2012).</p><h3>Analysis and Criticism</h3><p>To allow for new considerations to surface, the team developed PointRank. This develops a systematic method of ranking the pro and con points on the margins of the “chalkboard” and on the results page. The following are three criterions used in PointRank.</p><p>Persuasiveness: How convincing is the pro or con? This is determined by the ratio of users that included the point to the total number of viewers.</p><p>Diverse appeal: How convincing is the pro or con to both supporters and opponents? This illustrates common ground.</p><p>Raw Appeal: Simply the total number of people that included the point in their “chalkboard”.</p><p>These three criterions are combined linearly with equal weighting, which is a problem within the design of ConsiderIt. Future development should assign different weights to each of the criterion to facilitate a more accurate degree of salience. This criterion was ultimately devised to prevent manipulation of results in the Living Voters Guide, however the platform did not receive enough traffic to draw attack campaigns.</p><p>Participants showed the most concern with trust and identity. Users hesitated when adding other people’s points because of the idea of adopting points from strangers that they had no background knowledge about. Based off preliminary analysis, around half the points authored on the Living Voters Guide needed some potential sort of fact check, such as a numeric reference, source, textual content, or prediction about an outcome.<a href=""#_ftn1"" name=""_ftnref"" title="""" id=""_ftnref"">2</a> Users experienced difficulty with evaluating the trustworthiness of other people’s points. This greatly hindered the Living Voters Guide as being an information resource. In future progress and development, ConsiderIt wants to allow users to connect information sources to specific points in order to allow for fact checking. Another possible future addition would be to collaborate with public libraries and have them fact check points published on ConsiderIt.   </p><p>Users wanted to know more about the authors of points. According to social translucence, knowing more about the background of other users allows for better judgment and trust. However, on the other end of the spectrum is the Social Identity Theory, which threatens diverse engagement due to its way of recognizing other viewpoints as coming from an enemy, which in turn fosters a more bias atmosphere.<a href=""#_ftn2"" name=""_ftnref"" title="""" id=""_ftnref"">2</a>         </p><p><a href=""#_ftnref"" name=""_ftn1"" title="""" id=""_ftn1"">2</a> Travis Kriplean, Jonathan Morgan, Deen Freelon, Allen Borning, and Lance Bennett, ""Supporting Reflective Public Thought with ConsiderIt,"" <em>CSCW 2012: ACM Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work</em> (2012): 9, <a href=""http://dub.washington.edu/djangosite/media/papers/kriplean-cscw2012.pdf"">http://dub.washington.edu/djangosite/media/papers/kriplean-cscw2012.pdf</a> (accessed February 27, 2012).</p><p><a href=""#_ftnref"" name=""_ftn2"" title="""" id=""_ftn2"">2</a> Ibid., 9</p><h3>Secondary Sources</h3><p>Seattle Times opinion article written by the ConsiderIt design team</p><p>1 Bennitt, Lance, Alan Borning, and Diane Douglas.

"<h3>Definition</h3><p>In 2000, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF), a Japanese governmental administration, organized a National Consensus Conference on genetically- modified foods in Tokyo.</p><p>The consensus conference on GM food was the third consensus conference to be held in Japan, but had the distinction of being the first initiated on a national level. This conference was constructed after the <a href=""http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=PiEZEal3pjwC&oi=fnd&pg=PA31&dq=danish+consensus+conference+model&ots=17oimWQqOw&sig=mssYmzFQHvwm-zVkdWrrWSKoB9Q#v=onepage&q=danish%20consensus%20conference%20model&f=false"">Danish Consensus model </a>(Nishizawa and Renn 49).</p><p>According to Mariko Nishizawa and Otwin Renn, the Danish Consensus model is:</p><p>A three to four day public conference at which both technically and socially relevant aspects of a new technology are discussed. It is usually divided into four stages: selection of an overall topic; recruitment and selection of the lay panel members; two preparatory weekends; and the main conference. The citizen panel then produces the conference report (49).</p><p>However, in the Danish model of a consensus conference the lay panel decides which experts they will choose to speak before the panel.  At the Japan Consensus Conference, the steering panel decided which experts would speak at the conference (484). Even though the steering panel was made up of representatives from differing interests, there were still stakeholders on the panel. Had the lay panel been able to choose the speakers, it would have empowered them to make decisions, and there may have been a different outcome to this consensus conference.</p><p>The panel of lay citizens met in September of 2000 for two sessions to become familiar with the topic of GM foods and the process of the consensus conference.  The conference took place over three days in October and November of 2000.</p><p>MAFF stated that the aim of the citizen’s consensus was “to identify further research topics that took into account suggestions by members of the general public” (Nishizawa 481).</p><h3>Problems and Purpose</h3><p>The main aim of the consensus was to open up a dialogue between the public, experts and politicians concerning sensitive matters of technology and its future impact on citizens. The Japanese public was concerned about the effects of GM crops on their health and the unknown impact to the environment.</p><h3>History</h3><p>The consensus conference was held in 2000 and was the first time in the history of Japan that the government has sponsored a deliberative conference. The Japanese government convened the consensus conference. The conference was similar in model to the  Danish conference model in that it usually lasts for either three days or four days. Also the consensus conference is not designed to force the lay panel to reach a consensus. Instead, its main aim is to open up a dialogue among the public, experts and politicians over a controversial issue of science and technology from a citizen’s point of view.  The conference was open to the public and media.  The government wanted the conference open to the public to ensure transparency. This conference was seen as a chance for the Japanese government to earn back the trust of it citizens.</p><p>For more on the GMO Consensus Conference see the Participedia entry here: <a href=""http://participedia.net/en/cases/japanese-consensus-conference"">http://participedia.net/en/cases/japanese-consensus-conference</a></p><h3>Participant Selection</h3><p>The participant selection group of the panel was chosen by the society for techno-innovation of agriculture, forestry and fisheries (staff) through various ways. Some of the ways people found out about this panel was thru various media, including newspaper advertisement and flyers that were posted thru out the country. Eighteen people were selected out of nearly 500 people who signed up to be on the citizen’s panel. Participants were stratified by geographic location, sex, age and occupation.</p><p>Government officials along with people who represented the bio- tech industry either gave testimony or helped the steering committee pick who testified before the lay panel.</p><p>In an after action report done for the government ministry, some of the lay persons felt that the selection of experts by the steering committee was not appropriate, some of the experts selected had a bias slant towards the bio industry and not enough mainstream experts were allowed to testify. They felt that no anti-GMO representatives were allowed to testify.</p><h3><strong>Deliberation, Decisions, and Public Interaction</strong></h3><p>The panel sessions were open to the public and media. According to the media reports the deliberation was transparent. </p><p>After taking testimony from the panel of experts plus hearing from all sides, the panel came up with a decision. The panel deliberated for a few days before giving out its recommendation. The panel then gave their recommendations to the MAFF, which then commissioned another conference to identify future research subjects. The government made no commitment to act on the conferences recommendations but stated that, “depending on the proposals of the lay panel, we might reflect them in public policy.” ( Nishizawa 484)</p><h3>Influence, Outcomes, and Effects</h3><p>The panel neither strongly supported nor rejected any side of the debate on genetically modified crops. They remained very neutral about their finding on wither or not the benefits or risk was great to the public.  The panel gave the GM techniques and GMO crops a cautious approval. By giving this cautious approval it allowed for the current usage of the GM techniques from a viewpoint of natural and social science to be used as the current model. Their report emphasized benefits and risks of plant biotechnology. The committee then gave their report to the MAFF (Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries of Japan) and MHLW (Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare.)</p><h3>Analysis and Criticism</h3><p>Mariko Nishizawa states that in the Danish model of a consensus conference the lay panel decides which experts they will choose to speak before the panel.  At the Japan Consensus Conference, the steering panel decided which experts would speak at the conference (484). Even though the steering panel was made up of representatives from differing interests, there were still stakeholders on the panel. Had the lay panel been able to choose the speakers, it would have empowered them to make decisions, and there may have been a different outcome to this consensus conference.</p><p>Nishizawa remarks on the steering panel calling the speakers: “The organizer’s neutrality and accountability are vitally important for securing reliable, accurate procedures” (483).  </p><p>Nishizawa interviewed members of the lay panel after the conference was over, and found that the lay panel members were careful to temper their stance on GMOs during the conference, because they were concerned that it might jeopardize future public deliberations hosted by the government (483).</p><h3>Secondary Sources</h3><p>Starlink Corn Regulatory Information.

"<h3>Definition</h3><p>The Occupy Movement relies heavily on the use of social media as an organizing method to coordinate protest activities and connect individuals.  Protestors have create Facebook sites such as <em>Occupy Together</em> to coordinate mass protests.  Occupiers utilize Twitter to keep the public updated with constant tweets of activities at both protests and General Assembly meetings.  YouTube uploads of police brutality incite public uproar which furthers builds the movement, while more individuals participate in General Assembly meetings and decision making processes within the movement through livestreaming technology.  Through these means social media in all its forms has facilitated the growth and widespread popularity of the Occupy Movement.</p><h3>Problems and Purpose</h3><p>While the Occupy Movement protests against our democracy’s recent transformation into a “Corporacracy”, Conventional news sources such as print newspapers and cable television are  owned by Multimedia corporate conglomerates.  Because of this there is a conflict of interest in the coverage of occupy related events by most traditional news  and the interests and goals of the occupy movement to end corporate control of government, leading to often unsatisfactory coverage.  Not only this but Occupy camps have been broken up around the U.S., making it harder to convene on a physical level.  So protestors use social media not only to provide their own coverage which is no longer constrained by traditional media ownership, but also as a supplement to face-to face interactions, or even a replacement when these interaction are made impossible.  When police in California pepper sprayed peaceable protestors, it was recorded by onlookers who uploaded it to Facebook where it created a public outcry, holding the police and authority figures accountable to the public for their actions.  Because traditional news sources were not present when the protest-abuse happen, without the use of social media it never would have been recorded and distributed to the wider public.  Thus the purpose of social media within the Occupy Movement is not only to coordinate and connect protestors through the transcendence of physical boundaries, but also to dissipate the content constraints of the narrow-ownership of mainstream media and its corporate agenda, allowing for a wider diversity of voices and perspectives, and so a larger pool of information.</p><h3>History</h3><p>It was the popularization of non-political flash mobs that first utilized the concept of using social media as a way to organize large masses of people.  Beginning in December 2010 citizens of the Arab world used social media as an instrumental tool in a string of popular uprisings referred to as the Arab Spring. Often international journalists were banned from these countries by their governments and so the citizens relied upon social media like Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube to get their message out to the world.  As a result of this many of these nations, including Syria and Egypt, were able to oust their dictators and overthrow a corrupted regime.  Spain and Greece followed a similar model with their own anti-austerity protests, with the U.S. following shortly behind.  On July 13th <em>Adbusters,</em> a Canadian anti-consumerism blog, called for Americans to follow the lead of their Arab counterparts with their own “Tahrir” by means of 20,000 protestors peaceably occupying Zuccotti Park on September 17, 2011.  The protestors’ one demand would be for President Obama to instate a council charged with the task of separating corporate power and money from government.   This demand came in response growing wealth disparities within the United States and the use of taxpayer money on government bailouts for corrupt corporations, as well as a complete lack of legal consequences or repercussions.</p><h3>Participant Selection</h3><p>All protesters within the Occupy Movement have self-select themselves to be or not be active participants of the Movements’ social media division.  This allows for a greater diversity of voices to be heard than ever would be possible via tradition media venues because virtually anyone with internet access can now join the conversation.  However, individuals without access to internet are unable to contribute and therefore are less likely to have their voices heard- these individuals include the homeless and other lower divisions of the ninety-nine percent.  Secondly, when social media is so widely accessible that anyone and everyone can put out their opinions on whatever they want,  it begins to lacks legitimacy.  Occupiers have solved this issue by developing their own social media called <em>The Global Square</em>, which resembles a Facebook but is restricted to the occupy network.  You can only become a member by knowing someone who already is and being invited.  This solves the issue of social medias that are also corporations (like Facebook) from giving away relevant Occupy information to authorities.  By privatizing their information protestors can keep police off their scent for a little longer.  The network is being created specifically to help the Occupy Movement grow by linking like-minded people around the world and can be described as a mixing of the connective power of social networking and the political goals of the Occupy General Assembly meetings.  The network also differs from other social media in that it is group oriented instead of individualistically based; for anything to be posted an entire group within the network must agree upon it.  By doing this information dispersion is made more deliberative, instead of being at the whim of a single individual who may or may not have the agreement of his peers at his back.  </p><h3>Deliberation, Decisions, and Public Interaction</h3><p>The use of social media in the Occupy Movement allows for higher degrees of deliberation simply because there is a wider diversity of voices that can be heard, allowing for more balance in public opinion.  Central control by a singular power, as there often are in traditional forms of media news outlets, is lessened considerably because there is no central source.  I wider range of communication options are made available, such as one to one, one to many, and many to many.  Because of these factors there is a much heightened possibility for cooperative decision making within the process.  Simultaneously civil discourse is hurt by having so many unregulated voices, opinions, and discussions which often degrade into petty off-topic arguments on public forums.  The analytic vigor is heightened in that there are more viewpoints available and so individuals are more likely to receive all the information they would need to make the best choice possible, thus impacting the decisions that these individuals will eventually make.  For instance  if mainstream news isn’t covering the police brutality that is being inflicted on peaceful  protestors, then the public is missing out on information vital to accurately assessing the situation. However, when protestors have the available technology on their phones to record and publish this brutality themselves, then this knowledge gap is mended.  The down side of this is that with so much circulating information by so many different individuals,  misleading or illegitimate statements can be released and circulated, unduly influencing the decision making process with their falsities.  By  using live stream videos the decision making process is opened up further, so that  people who would normally be unable to participate in the discussion over long distances, are now able to participate in the democratic decision making process.  Social media can also increases the level of public interaction by giving individuals the opportunity to participate on less intimate levels.  For those who are unwilling to sleep at the camps or join in the marches, they can still support the movement through Facebook, Twitter, blogging, and other forms of social media. However it can also cause less public interaction because people feel they can participate in the movement from a laptop and don’t need to be part of General Assembly meetings or face to face conversations.</p><h3>Influence, Outcomes, and Effects</h3><p>Through social media the occupy movement was able to reach an international scope.  Without it the Arab Spring would not have been  the same movement that it was, nor as successful, and it would not have been an inspiration for the writers of <em>Adbusters.  </em>The movement has not only spread from New York through-out the United States but around the world.  However, during the colder months occupy has died down, especially as police crackdown on the Occupy camp sites.  This causes participation to wane because as successful as social media has been it will never be able to completely replace face to face interactions, without which the movement would dwindle, because it is at the local level that protestors become truly involved.  The easy accessibility of social media for anyone with a computer matched with the largely applicable message of Occupy has given it the effect of bringing the largely apathetic youth population back into the political world.</p><h3>Analysis and Criticism</h3><p>While social media has been a fundamental part of the rise and spread of the occupy movement and its message, it can never function as the primary aspect of the movement; face to face interaction will always be necessary in connecting protestors on the local level.  Because while social media can connect people across distances, it is the local level of participation which interlocks individuals into the movement.  And while social media does allow for a greater diversity of voices it also allows for a greater diversity of misinformation, where one faulty fact without backing can be perpetuated over and over across a wide variety of social mediums, even after it is disproven.  Despite this, the method by which social movements form and run their course has morphed permanently to encompass social media.</p><h3>Secondary Sources</h3><p>Preston, J.

"<h3>Definition</h3><p>The term deliberation describes a communicative process with the goal of finding solutions to given problems. Definitions of deliberation vary greatly from very open conceptions that basically include any kind of talk to conceptions that focus on a rational discourse and specific ways of expression. These different notions of deliberation share the idea of the search of the solutions to a given problem. Thus deliberation is always a productive and creative process.</p><p>„Deliberation is actually an imaginative rehearsal of various courses of conduct. We give way, in our mind, to some impulse; we try, in our mind, some plan. Following its career through various steps, we find ourselves in imagination in the presence of the consequences that would follow: and we then like and approve, or dislike and disapprove, these consequences, we find the original impulse or plan good or bad.“ (Dewey 1960: 135)</p><p>Another important feature all definitions of deliberation share is the notion of publicity. The idea of deliberation is linked to conceptions of the public sphere as opposed to private talk. This link also explains why deliberation is a concept mostly discussed in political theory. Here deliberation is linked to the concept of democracy. <em>Deliberative democracy</em> is described as a process of those affected by a decision coming together to discuss the respective matter under conditions of fairness, freedom from domination, equality and reciprocity. However diverse the interests and identities of deliberators might be, they should keep an open mind and be open to opinion change as they perceive the arguments of others.</p><p>Deliberative democracy is best understood in comparison to common conceptions of democracy. The central mechanism of common conceptions of democracy consists of voting. The basic idea is that the will of individuals is expressed quantitatively. The rule of ""one person one vote"" ensures equality, while each can decide selfishly in accordance with his or her own interests. In this cumulative process the majority is decisive: 50 per cent plus one vote wins. In deliberative democracy, in comparison, deliberators ideally talk as long as it takes to reach a consensus. They are oriented towards the common good and thus seek to include the interests of others in their personal decisions. The openness to learning and opinion change enables the deliberators to grow together and overcome differences in opinion and fundamental objections. In the end of this process there are no clear winners and losers but rather everyone wins and loses a little. Ideally everyone wins as not a compromise but a true consensus emerges.</p><p>To understand deliberation one more distinction is key: the one between micro and macro deliberation. Micro deliberation refers to the unmediated conversation between those people affected by a decision. Micro deliberation is thus related to both participatory and direct democracy. Macro deliberation on the other hand describes a large scale communicative process characterized by mediation. Jane Mansbridge terms this the <em>deliberative system</em>: Citizens, activists, journalists and politicians talk to each other. Not all at the same time, but one to the other. They perceive different opinions through newspapers, television and the internet. The political decisions made in the end by office holders are a result of macro deliberation.</p><h3>History</h3><p>One cannot track with specificity when deliberation as a political practice started. On the search for the roots of the practice of deliberation one might start with the ancient Greek polis around 500 B.C. on which all those with citizenship (free men) had the right to gather and deliberate about public matters. This kind of deliberation is later reflected in the deliberative procedures in European and North American parliaments starting around 1000. And one should not overlook the role of social movements in developing deliberative practices. Many features of deliberation, like the notion of freedom from domination and decision making among equals, were key elements of anarchist movements.</p><p>In contrast to these practical experiences of deliberation, the history of ideas of deliberation can be traced with more precision. Some principles of deliberation can be traced back in democratic theory to works as early as Jean-Jaques Rousseau's (1712-1778). His idea of a <em>social contract </em>consisted of people of a polity coming togehter (micro deliberation) and discussing public matters in accordance with the common good. Rousseau's decision making process ended with voting, not with consensus. Nevertheless, most features of deliberation are apparent: unmediated communication in small, decentral units, a relatively equal distribution of wealth, and an orientation towards the common good and thus aiming at consensus.</p><p>The two founding fathers of deliberative democracy, however, are said to be John Rawls and Jürgen Habermas. While Rawls and Habermas did not speak of deliberative democracy (at first) their conceptions of justice, an overarching consensus (Rawls) and a public sphere free from domination (Habermas) inspired the academic discourse that was to follow. This discourse actually started with Joseph M. Bessette coining the term ""deliberative democracy"" in the essay with the same title as early as 1980. Only after the translation of Habermas' The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere (1962) in 1989 did the academic discourse on deliberative democracy pick up speed. Major publication by scholars like John Dryzek, Jon Elster, Amy Gutmann and Dennis Thompson, Joshua Cohen, James Fishkin, James Bohmann, Jane Mansbridge, Iris Marion Young and many others followed.</p><h3>Analysis and Criticism</h3><p>The ideal of deliberation has been faced with different kinds of criticism. Realist democratic theorist argue that  a deliberative democracy can never be realized because modern capitalist societies are based on inequality. Deliberation is thus always governed by hierarchies which contradicts the ideal of freedom from domination. In this view a division of labour between leaders and followers is necessary. For the reason of scarce resources democracy can only take the form or representation.</p><p>Difference democrats argue that the ideal of consensus decision making and the orientation towards the common goods carries repressive features. If everyone is supposed to agree on one outcome those with fewer resources in a deliberative setting will feel greater pressure to conform. This inequality in deliberative setting mirrors inequalities and hierarchies in society. Thus marginalized groups like women, ethnic and sexual minorities, older, handicapped and poor people will be disadvantaged by deliberation. While voting secures the same influence by everyone, deliberation gives weight to the strongest arguments. The arguments that are perceived as the strongest will most likely be uttered by those with greater educational resources and rhetorical skills.</p><p>Another criticism uttered towards macro deliberation is that it might maintain the current status quo of inequality. If we perceive the current democratic system as deliberative, than it might be deduced that equality has also been achieved, since deliberative democracy requires equality. Radical democrats call for contestation, public demonstration and social movements activity to challenge the ruling order. Deliberation, in this view, appears reformist at best.</p><h3>Secondary Sources</h3>Bessette, Joseph (1980) ""Deliberative Democracy: The Majority Principle in Republican Government,"" in How Democratic is the Constitution?, Washington, D.C., AEI Press. pp. 102–116.<p>Chappell, Zsusanna (2012): Deliberative Democracy – A Critical Introduction, Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan.</p><p>Dewey, John (1960): Theory of the Moral Life, New York: Holt, Rinehart and Winston.</p><p>Habermas, J.

"<h3> </h3><p class=""image-right""><img alt=""real time democracy"" height=""300"" src=""http://1.1.1.2/bmi/www.opendemocracy.net/files/current%20voting%20weights.jpg"" width=""360"" /><br /><br /> </p><p>Real time democracy is a system based around transforming the vote from a single use ticket issued once every four years, to a permanent possession of the voter – something that is lent (in part or full) to a representative the voter trusts to defend their interests and their vision of society (while they focus on their daily lives) and which can be withdrawn without notice.</p><p>The system is most easily conceived as an online voting system in which each voter would have a personal homepage. The most important feature on this page would be the voters “pot”. Upon the first log in, this pot would contain their entire vote. They would then be able to break this vote into portions of whatever size they liked, called tokens, and proceed to distribute them to representatives.  A voter could, for example, give a third of their vote to a candidate who shared their economic views, another third to one with a position on the environment they shared, a sixth to a candidate advocating for a persecuted minority, and the final sixth to a candidate advocating for their local community.</p><p>This last option is significant, as while such a system would be, by its nature, inimical to district based voting, it would allow for local representation where it was desired – something very difficult in current models of proportional representation where people have one vote, once every four years, which they can dedicate to local or national issues: but not both. Indeed one can imagine a community that felt it had been abandoned by the broader political class quickly pooling a substantial chunk of its votes behind a candidate standing for the sole purpose of advocating on its behalf.</p><p>The representatives’ voting power would increase and decrease in proportion with their share of active vote tokens. A representative with a total of 10% of active vote tokens would cast a vote that counts for twice that of her colleague with 5% of active tokens, and half of that of a representative with 20%. Percentages of active tokens would also be important in allocating speaking time, and the number of opportunities a representative would have to introduce a motion.</p><p>Importantly, representatives would be required to announce their position on upcoming motions in advance, giving the voter a chance to withdraw their token before it is used against their wishes.</p><p>There would be strong arguments for a maximum for the amount of voting power a single representative could wield, (somewhere around 40 percent for example). Also, while it seems necessary that any voter would be able to stand as a representative instantly and at will, it may be decided that a minimum threshold for support must be reached before voting or speaking rights are granted (and certainly before a salary is paid to allow the representative to dedicate themselves to politics full time). Alternatively the system could allow for micro-representatives, people charged with care of the votes of their friends and neighbors, or of fellow followers of a niche political position. Voters who had the time and inclination could also decide to keep all their tokens and vote directly. Alternatively (or as well) this body could not be paired, in a bicameral system with a direct popular referendum on each motion passed, thereby allowing for a body of professionals who could dedicate themselves to detailed public debate of issues, without handing over power to them completely.</p><p>Also, for simplicity's sake, rather than being infinitely flexible the vote could be permanently broken into a set number of tokens (ten, a hundred, whatever), which the voter would allocate in the same manner – though my inclination is to give people as much control as possible.  Such details however, are probably best worked out through practice.</p><h3>Every day election day<strong> </strong></h3><p>The most obvious advantage of such a system is increased accountability. In a sense this is a model of democracy without elections, in another sense it is a model where every day is election day. This would bind representatives far more closely to their constituents, and I believe, force them to take more consistent long term positions, rather than promising one thing before the election, and doing another for the duration of their term.</p><p>It would also mean an end to package deal politics, where voters are forced to choose between platforms despite the fact that they are unlikely to comprehensively agree with any of them.</p><p>At present, if you agree with one (or five) out of ten of Party (or candidate) X's policies, but none out of ten of Party Y's you have the choice of withdrawing your support for the policy you do endorse, or granting it to the policies you don't. The existence of a Party Z (leaving aside the biases against third parties in our current system) actually does little to moderate this effect, as the chances of them agreeing with their voters about every conceivable issue is no more likely.</p><p>This problem is compounded by the fact that in reality, the issues that will come before a voting body are not known in advance, and that politicians can simply abandon or change sections of their platforms once the votes are cast – meaning your vote can be used to advance the nine policies you disagreed with (and three new ones), and not at all for the issues which motivated you to cast it. Under real time democracy, the voter would be able to pick and choose what issues their voting power was used for, and in which direction it was cast.</p><p>Another advantage of this system is an end to political party hacks – those rewarded with safe seats for their obedience to (and ability to fundraise for) the party machine. These people are essentially granted leadership roles because of their ability to follow. They bring nothing to the debate.</p><p>In the system I am proposing only a candidate who had fresh ideas and a direct appeal to voters would be of any use to political parties. It is likely in such a system that any parties that did exist would only field one or a few candidates, of exceptional merit, in any particular assembly. The purpose of the parties would be to push for co-ordinated approaches in various bodies (i.e. local, state and federal governments).</p><h3>Belief in democracy<strong> </strong></h3><p>One of the main objections raised to this model is that it expects too much of ordinary people, who are thought of as either too lazy or too stupid to be involved in an ongoing way in politics. To the argument that they are too lazy, I answer that the current level of participation, both in street and online politics – despite the fact that neither of these realms is invested with any formal power - tells a different story. People get engaged when they see that issues affect their lives. To those who fear that people are not intelligent enough to be engaged at this level, I ask, do you really believe in democracy at all?</p><p>Furthermore, I think this system would improve the level of public debate. Currently, many ordinary people consider a detailed discussion of politics to be a waste of their time. They are not entirely wrong. Under the current arrangement, short of serious political activism, which most people have neither the time nor inclination to engage in except in exceptional circumstances, their political power is limited to a four-yearly choice from a very limited selection of platforms, over which they have no detailed say - a problem which is even more serious for marginalized groups. Indeed, considering the fundamental flaws of the current system (not to mention it's corruption by powerful special interests), what is remarkable is not that many people do not bother to participate, but that so many still do. This is a sign of people’s deep and inherent urge to have a say in the collective decisions that face society.</p><p>Essentially, this is a system whose time has come. Just as the printing press and other mass media made universal suffrage possible and meaningful, digital communication allows for its transformation.</p><h3>Notes</h3><p>The following is an excerpt from the Essay ""Fumbling for Change"" [available at <a href=""http://www.opendemocracy.net/austin-gerassimos-mackell/fumbling-for-change"">http://www.opendemocracy.net/austin-gerassimos-mackell/fumbling-for-change</a>]. No other work on the concept has yet been published. In this article the name given to the model was ""Real Time Democracy"". Since then it struck me that this name is slightly too grandiose as this is just a voting system, rather than a whole democratic system, of which voting is just a part. Hence it has been renamed here ""Real Time Voting""</p>",en,580,Real Time Voting 
"<h3>Definition</h3><p>A Citizens’ Initiative Review (CIR) is a <a href=""http://participedia.net/methods/citizens-jury"">Citizens’ Jury</a> that deliberates about a ballot <a href=""http://participedia.net/methods/initiative-process"">initiative</a>. In a CIR, organizers select a panel, made up of a random sample of 18-24 citizens, who are demographically representative of the population. The panelists meet for five days to learn and deliberate about a ballot initiative—a proposed law or constitutional amendment that is drafted by, and can be enacted by a direct vote of, citizens—that will be voted on in an upcoming election.</p><p>During the CIR, the panelists hear arguments from advocates and stakeholders supporting and opposing the initiative, as well as neutral background witnesses’ presentations about issues related to the initiative.  Panelists have opportunities to question the advocates, stakeholders, and background witnesses. Then the panelists deliberate to identify important facts about the initiative, to decide whether to support or oppose the initiative, and to identify reasons to justify their support or opposition.  The panelists’ deliberations are structured and led by a moderator, who ensures that each panelist’s voice and opinion are heard and considered. </p><p>At the end of the CIR, the panelists write a Citizens’ Statement that sets out the facts about the initiative that they agree on, the number of panelists supporting and opposing the initiative, and the panelists’ reasons for supporting and opposing the initiative. The Citizens’ Statement is then made available to the public and the media. In some jurisdictions, such as the U.S. state of Oregon, the Citizens’ Statement is included in the official voters’ guide, a booklet, published by the government, that gives citizens information about candidates and ballot measures to be voted on in an election.  A CIR thus lets voters hear from well-informed citizens who help voters make the best choice regarding an initiative.</p><h3>Problems and Purpose</h3><p>The key problem the CIR seeks to address is that voters often receive inadequate information about ballot initiatives. Surveys show that many voters are unaware of ballot initiatives before election day. In addition, surveys show that many voters have inaccurate knowledge of ballot initiatives and few voters can express reasons to support or oppose particular ballot initiatives. Further, long-term public policy problems arising from ballot initiatives and the high rate at which ballot initiatives are struck down by courts indicate that many voters lack sufficient information about the policy consequences and the legality of ballot initiatives. The purpose of the CIR is to remedy these problems by improving the quality of information voters receive about ballot initiatives.</p><h3><strong>History</strong></h3><p>In 1999 in the U.S. state of Washington Michael Lowry, former governor of the state, proposed applying the Citizens’ Jury process to Washington State ballot initiatives; this new process was called Citizens’ Initiative Review. </p><p>From 1999-2007, Ned Crosby, founder of <a href=""http://participedia.net/organizations/jefferson-center"">the Jefferson Center</a>, which developed the Citizens’ Jury, and his wife Patricia Benn developed and promoted the CIR process in Washington State, but the CIR was not incorporated into Washington State’s official initiative process.</p><p>In 2000 John Gastil, in his book <em>By Popular Demand: Revitalizing Representative Democracy Through Deliberative Elections</em>, recommended that the Citizens’ Jury be applied to initiatives and referenda.</p><p>As early as 2002 a Website for the Washington Citizens' Initiative Review was  established at the URL: cirwa.org.  (For archived versions of that Website, <a href=""http://wayback.archive.org/web/20020515000000*/http://www.cirwa.org"">click here</a>).</p><p>In 2003 Gastil and Crosby wrote an <a href=""http://www.seattlepi.com/local/opinion/article/Voters-need-more-reliable-information-1128957.php"">op-ed article</a> reporting survey results showing that Washington State citizens had little knowledge of the initiatives on the 2003 Washington State ballot, and citing these results as evidence of the need for a CIR.</p><p>According to Tyrone Reitman, Crosby and Benn also advocated for the CIR in the U.S. state of Oregon in 2003.</p><p>In 2005 Crosby and others founded a nonprofit organization called <a href=""http://promotinghealthydemocracy.org/"">Promoting Healthy Democracy</a> (PHD), which began supporting CIR projects in 2009.</p><p>In 2006, Tyrone Reitman and Elliot Shuford organized a project to introduce the CIR in the U.S. state of Oregon. Crosby and Benn agreed to fund the project.  In early 2007 Reitman and Shuford founded <a href=""http://participedia.net/organizations/healthy-democracy-oregon"">Healthy Democracy Oregon</a> (HDO), an organization that would carry out the project, which was called the <a href=""http://participedia.net/cases/oregon-citizens-initiative-review-oregon-cir"">Oregon Citizens’ Initiative Review</a> (Oregon CIR). After a successful trial in 2008 the Oregon Legislature authorized the Oregon CIR for the 2010 election. In 2010 two Oregon CIRs were held and produced two Citizens’ Statements, which were included in the official 2010 Oregon voters’ guide.  In 2011 the Oregon Legislature passed a law making Oregon CIR a permanent part of Oregon’s statewide initiative process.</p><p>In 2011 HDO created a new, related organization, <a href=""http://healthydemocracyfund.org/"">Healthy Democracy Fund</a> (HDF). HDF’s activities include raising funds to sustain the Oregon CIR, further developing the CIR process, and applying the CIR method to public policy issues in legislatures in a process called Citizens’ Policy Review.</p><h3><strong>Deliberation, Decisions, and Public Interaction</strong></h3><p>Once the CIR organizers have chosen the panel, advocates, stakeholders, and background witnesses, the organizers gather the panel and explain the panel’s charge. The panel’s charge is to write a Citizens’ Statement explaining key facts about the initiative that a majority of the panel agrees about, stating how many panelists support or oppose the initiative, and setting out the reasons that the panelists support or oppose the initiative. The charge acts as a guideline for the panel, the advocates, the stakeholders, and the background witnesses.</p><p>On the first day of the CIR the panelists learn about the CIR procedures, practice deliberating according to the CIR procedures while using a hypothetical initiative, receive a brief overview of the actual initiative that will be the subject of their deliberations, and get to know each other. The next three days are dedicated to hearings at which advocates, stakeholders, and background witnesses present arguments and information to the panel. There is time allotted for the panelists to ask question of the advocates, stakeholders, and background witnesses, and also time for the panelists to deliberate.  Trained moderators organize the questioning and deliberations to ensure that all advocates, stakeholders, and background witnesses are treated fairly and that all panelists have the opportunity to be heard. </p><p>After the hearings have been completed the panelists engage in final deliberations about the initiative. These deliberations are also moderated.  During these deliberations the panelists decide on key facts about the initiative that a majority of panelists agree on, determine whether they support or oppose the initiative, and choose the best arguments supporting or opposing the initiative. Once these decisions have been made the panelists write a Citizens’ Statement that sets out those key facts, the number of panelists supporting or opposing the initiative, and their reasons for supporting or opposing the initiative.</p><p>On the final day of the CIR there is a public event at which the panelists present their Citizens’ Statement. In some jurisdictions the Citizens’ Statement is included in the official voters’ guide that explains ballot initiatives to voters. </p><p>An important part of the CIR process is the panelists’ evaluation of the CIR process. The panelists are asked to evaluate the process itself and the CIR personnel who moderate and organize the CIR. The panelists use several criteria to evaluate the CIR including the quality of the deliberations and any bias in the process or exhibited by CIR personnel.  As part of the evaluation each panelist may write a personal statement in which he or she may express views that were not included in the Citizens’ Statement.</p><p>Some time after the CIR has concluded the CIR organizers publish a final report about the CIR. The final report includes the Citizens’ Statement, the panelists’ evaluations of the CIR, and descriptions of the CIR process.</p><h3>Influence, Outcomes, and Effects</h3><p>In 2008 HDO conducted a successful field test using the CIR process.  In 2009 the Oregon Legislature approved a trial of the Oregon Citizens’ Initiative Review (Oregon CIR) to be held the following year. In 2010 HDO organized two Oregon CIRs, in each of which a randomly selected sample of 24 Oregon citizens learned and deliberated for five days about an initiative that was to appear on the November 2010 Oregon statewide ballot.</p><p>The first 2010 Oregon CIR, held August 9-13, 2010, concerned Measure 73, a proposed statute that would impose mandatory minimum criminal sentences for certain repeat offenses concerning driving while intoxicated, and for certain sexual offenses. For details about <a href=""http://participedia.net/cases/oregon-citizens-initiative-review-2010-measure-73"">Oregon CIR 2010 Measure 73</a>, <a href=""http://participedia.net/cases/oregon-citizens-initiative-review-2010-measure-73"">click here</a>.</p><p>The second 2010 Oregon CIR, held August 16-20, 2010, concerned Measure 74, a proposed statute that would have created a regulated distribution system for medical marijuana in Oregon. For details about <a href=""http://participedia.net/cases/oregon-citizens-initiative-review-2010-measure-74"">Oregon CIR 2010 Measure 74</a>, <a href=""http://participedia.net/cases/oregon-citizens-initiative-review-2010-measure-74"">click here</a>.</p><p>During each Oregon CIR the panelists produced a Citizens’ Statement evaluating the initiative that they had deliberated about. Those Citizens’ Statements were printed in the official 2010 Oregon Voters’ Pamphlet.</p><p>John Gastil, Katherine Knobloch, and colleagues conducted a study of the 2010 Oregon CIRs. The key results of the study were:</p><ul><li>The Oregon CIR panelists had engaged in deliberations of good quality, including consistently ""fair and respectful discussions"";</li><li>The Oregon CIR Citizens’ Statements accurately reflected their deliberations, contained no substantial factual or logical errors, and contained new and useful information for voters;</li><li>Surveys of Oregon voters showed that (1) most Oregon voters were unaware of the Oregon CIRs; (2) 65% of Oregon voters read the Citizens’ Statement concerning Measure 73 and 57% read the Citizens’ Statement on Measure 74; (3) for those voters who read the Citizens' Statements, reading the Citizens' Statements significantly increased voters' knowledge of and reduced voters' support for Measures 73 and 74; (4) the effect of reading the Citizens' Statements on voters' opposition to the ballot initiatives was too small to have influenced the outcome of the 2010 Oregon statewide election, but was large enough to indicate that in a future close ballot initiative election, a Citizens' Statement could potentially influence the outcome.</li></ul><p>For detailed results of <a href=""http://participedia.net/cases/oregon-citizens-initiative-review-2010-measure-73"">Oregon CIR 2010 Measure 73</a>, <a href=""http://participedia.net/cases/oregon-citizens-initiative-review-2010-measure-73"">click here</a>.</p><p>For detailed results of <a href=""http://participedia.net/cases/oregon-citizens-initiative-review-2010-measure-74"">Oregon CIR 2010 Measure 74</a>, <a href=""http://participedia.net/cases/oregon-citizens-initiative-review-2010-measure-74"">click here</a>.</p><p>In 2011 the Oregon Legislature passed a law making the Oregon CIR a permanent part of Oregon’s statewide initiative process.</p><h3>Analysis and Criticism</h3><p>Gastil and Knobloch's study of the 2010 Oregon CIR concluded that the CIR design used during the 2010 Oregon CIRs had been generally ""appropriate and effective."" In their 2010 report and in subsequent papers they also recommended several modifications to the CIR process:</p><ul><li>To enhance the stability and the knowledge base of a CIR, a CIR in a particular jurisdiction should be governed by a permanent board, whose members should include CIR organizers and moderators, public officials from the jurisdiction, and former CIR panelists.</li><li>If possible, CIR organizers should try to hold CIRs on every ballot initiative to appear on a ballot, and to schedule CIRs well in advance to allow advocates, stakeholders, and expert witnesses ample time to prepare their presentations.</li><li>CIR organizers should offer advocates training concerning how to make effective presentations to a CIR panel, because advocates are likely to be unfamiliar with the procedures and time constraints of the CIR.</li><li>If fewer than all initiatives to appear on a ballot can be addressed by CIRs, when choosing which ballot initiatives to review, CIR organizers should use particular selection criteria, such as the fiscal or legal impact of the initiative, the complexity of the issue, and the extent of voters’ uncertainty about the issue. Using such selection criteria will ensure that CIRs address ballot initiatives about which voters most need information.</li><li>The voting requirement for including a key factual finding in a Citizens’ Statement should be raised from 14 to 18, to ensure that included findings have broad support among panelists.</li><li>Citizens’ Statements should address general concerns and include value-based arguments, so as to be more accessible and relevant to voters.</li><li>CIR organizers should assure panelists that unanimous support for or opposition to a ballot initiative is an acceptable outcome of the CIR. This assurance should prevent panelists from taking a position that is contrary to their views, merely in order to avoid a unanimous outcome.</li><li>CIR organizers should give panelists sufficient time to deliberate about their reasons for approving and opposing the initiative, especially when one side has relatively little support, because such deliberation improves the quality of those reasons.</li></ul><p>The Social Capital Review published an article, by DeAnna Martin, about the Oregon CIR. The article summarized the Oregon CIR process in a positive light. The article compared the Oregon CIR's participant-selection procedure to the Jury Process, and saw the Oregon CIR as a beneficial addition to Oregon’s democracy.</p><p>Some criticisms of the Oregon CIR have been expressed by proponents of Measure 73. These advocates argued that the Oregon CIR process was flawed on the grounds that the Oregon CIR sampling procedure was not stratified on the basis of support for or opposition to the measures; that advocates were not allowed to cross-examine other advocates, stakeholders, or background witnesses; and that advocates, stakeholders, and background witnesses were not required to testify under oath.</p><h3>Secondary Sources</h3><p>Binder, M., Boudreau, C., & Kousser, T.

"<h3>Definition</h3><p>Choicework Dialogue -- also called Choice-Dialogue or ChoiceDialogue -- developed by <a href=""http://participedia.net/organizations/viewpoint-learning"">Viewpoint Learning</a>, is a structured and facilitated method of face-to-face, in-person deliberation in which a representative sample of approximately 40 citizens deliberates for 8 hours about a policy issue. Choicework Dialogue has been used for public deliberations about public policy issues as well as for intraorganizational deliberations about organizational policies. The method requires participants to read workbooks containing information about the policy issue, consider several possible policy approaches -- each of which is associated with certain values -- for addressing the issue, consider multiple means of funding those policy approaches, identify policy objectives, and then weigh tradeoffs in making feasible policy and funding choices that will further those objectives. Surveys measure participants' attitudes about the issue at the start and end of the deliberation. Survey results are used by the organization sponsoring the deliberation as evidence of informed public opinion about the issue.</p><h3>Problems and Purpose</h3><p>According to <a href=""http://participedia.net/organizations/viewpoint-learning"">Viewpoint Learning</a>, the Choicework Dialogue method is intended to address the problems of volatility and superficiality in public opinion research.  Research and theory suggest that most citizens are poorly informed about, and so do not have informed opinions about, most public policy issues. Research also suggests that citizens when considering policy issues in everyday life do not ordinarily consider the tradeoffs in interests or values that are usually necessary to choose a public policy that is both feasible and acceptable to a diverse public. Accordingly, results of most public opinion polls are likely to be volatile and to have low validity, and are unlikely to reflect tradeoffs in values or interests. The Choicework Dialogue method -- by guiding a representative sample of citizens through a structured deliberation that requires participants to learn about a policy issue, to consider multiple policy approaches each of which is associated with values held by large numbers of citizens, and to make tradeoffs in values or interests necessary to creating a policy that is feasible, capable of broad public support, and effective at furthering policy goals -- is designed to produce public opinion survey results that are more stable and valid than are most public opinion polls, and that reflect tradeoffs in interests or values.</p><h3>History</h3><p>According to Yankelovich (1991), the term ""choicework"" was introduced by David Mathews of the <a href=""http://participedia.net/organizations/kettering-foundation"">Kettering Foundation</a> -- perhaps in the 1980s -- to describe several deliberation methods intended to enable participants to ""work through"" difficult policy problems. Yankelovich subsequently used the term ""Choicework Dialogue"" to describe his particular three-stage dialogue method. Later Yankelovich's organization <a href=""http://participedia.net/organizations/viewpoint-learning"">Viewpoint Learning</a> changed the name of this three-stage dialogue method to Choice-Dialogue.</p><p>Choicework Dialogue has been used in many public policy deliberations, including:</p><ul><li>Beyond Wishful Thinking: Californians Deliberate State Budget Reform (2008)</li><li>California Citizen Dialogues on K-12 Education Reform (2007)</li><li>Citizen Dialogues on Covering the Uninsured (2004)</li><li>Citizen Dialogues on Paying for Health Care in Retirement (2008)</li><li>Citizen Dialogues on the Coming of Age in Arizona (2003)</li><li>Citizens' Dialogue on Canada’s Future (2002)</li><li><a href=""http://participedia.net/cases/citizens-dialogue-future-health-care-canada"">Citizens' Dialogue on the Future of Health Care in Canada</a> (2002)</li><li>Citizens' Dialogue on the Long-term Management of Used Nuclear Fuel in Canada (2004)</li><li><a href=""http://participedia.net/cases/commonground-first-five-years-dialogue-early-childhood-new-mexico"">CommonGround: The First Five Years: A Dialogue on Early Childhood in New Mexico</a> (2010)</li><li>Facing Up to Our Nation's Finances: Changing Expectations: Americans Deliberate our Nation’s Finances and Future (2006-2007)</li><li>The Future of Housing in San Mateo: Citizen Dialogues (2003)</li><li>The Future of the San Diego Region’s Airport: Choice-Dialogues with County Residents (2004)</li><li>Health Coverage for All Arizonans: Citizen Dialogues (2005)</li><li>Health Coverage for All Californians: Dialogues with the Public (2005-2006)</li><li>Listening to Californians: California Citizens' Dialogues About California's Government (2004)</li><li>San Diego Dialogues on Community Water Fluoridation (2005-2007)</li><li>Sustainability Research Initiative: Listening to the Public: Understanding and Overcoming Barriers to Sustainability: [Vancouver ChoiceDialogues] (2005) </li><li>Voices for Health Care: Engaging the Public to Advance Signiﬁcant Health Care Reform (2008)</li></ul><h3>Participant Selection</h3><a href=""http://participedia.net/organizations/viewpoint-learning"">Viewpoint Learning</a> often describes the participant selection process for Choicework Dialogues that address public issues as ""random selection"" such that the participants are ""representative of the broader population.""  Each sample consists of approximately 40 participants.<h3>Deliberation, Decisions, and Public Interaction</h3><p>The following description of a Choicework Dialogue about a public policy issue is based on the method used during the <a href=""http://participedia.net/cases/citizens-dialogue-future-health-care-canada"">Citizens' Dialogue on the Future of Health Care in Canada</a>.</p><p>The goal of a Choicework Dialogue about a public policy issue is usually to give guidance to government officials or other community leaders respecting informed public opinion about the policy issue.</p><p>To prepare for a Choicework Dialogue about a public policy issue, a project team -- often consisting of personnel from the sponsoring organization, the facilitating organization, and one or more local partner organizations -- generally reads relevant scholarly and policy literature and consults with experts on the issue and stakeholders respecting the issue, including government officials.</p><p>From those information sources the project team writes a workbook describing a small number of important dimensions or sub-issues of the principal policy issue, the facts related to those sub-issues, up to four ""scenarios,"" and advantages and disadvantages of each ""scenario."" A ""scenario"" is an account combining a description of a broad policy approach -- or set of policy instruments -- that is related to important values believed to be held by a large portion of the relevant community, with descriptions of  advantages and disadvantages associated with that approach.  A ""scenario"" generally does not describe policy objectives. The workbook also usually describes several options for funding each scenario.</p><p>After the project team completes a draft of the workbook experts and stakeholders are invited to comment on the draft workbook. Using those comments the project team makes final revisions to the workbook.</p><p>Each Choicework Dialogue consists of one continuous, 8-hour session, and has approximately 40 participants.</p><p><a href=""http://participedia.net/organizations/viewpoint-learning"">Viewpoint Learning</a> calls the first part of a Choicework Dialogue ""Opinion Formation."" At the start of each Choicework Dialogue each participant receives a workbook. Trained facilitators explain ""the purpose of the dialogue,"" how the results of the dialogue will be used, and the procedure and ""ground-rules"" of the dialogue for the session. The facilitators then explain the important sub-issues discussed in the workbook and present facts concerning them. Next, the facilitators explain the scenarios described in the workbook.  At this point the participants complete a survey respecting their beliefs about the sub-issues described in the workbook and their attitudes respecting each of the scenarios and funding methods described in the workbook. </p><p>After completing the survey the second part of the Choicework Dialogue -- called ""Working Through"" -- begins.  During this second part of the dialogue participants engage in discussions in small groups and in plenary sessions to determine desirable and undesirable effects of each scenario and the participants' preferred ""vision of the future"" respecting the policy issue that is the subject of the Choicework Dialogue. The ""vision of the future"" contains policy objectives. Trained facilitators moderate the small-group and plenary discussions to ensure compliance with the ground-rules.   </p><p>Once the ""vision of the future"" has been agreed the participants break for a meal. After the meal the Choicework Dialogue participants work again in small groups and plenary sessions to discuss the tradeoffs respecting the scenarios and funding methods that would be required to realize their preferred ""vision of the future."" Once again trained facilitators moderate the small-group and plenary discussions to ensure compliance with the ground-rules.</p><p>During the third and final part of the Choicework Dialogue, called ""Resolution,"" during their discussions of scenarios, funding methods, and tradeoffs a majority of participants typically reach agreement on one or more scenarios -- or components of scenarios -- and funding methods that make up their preferred policy approaches. At the end of these discussions participants complete another survey respecting their beliefs about the sub-issues described in the workbook and their attitudes respecting each of the scenarios and funding methods described in the workbook.</p><p>After the conclusion of the Choicework Dialogue the project team analyzes the survey results. During some Choicework Dialogues the project team interviews some participants and/or records the dialogue, and then conducts qualitative analysis of the interviews and/or the dialogue as reflected in the recording. The project team writes a report describing the qualitative and quantitative results of the dialogue. Finally, the project team shares the report with the sponsoring organization.</p><h3>Influence, Outcomes, and Effects</h3><p>In terms of effects on participants, quantitative results of many Choicework Dialogues show that participants' beliefs or attitudes about information in the workbook undergo substantial change during the dialogues.  For example, reported quantitative results of the <a href=""http://participedia.net/cases/citizens-dialogue-future-health-care-canada"">Citizens' Dialogue on the Future of Health Care in Canada</a> showed that participants' attitudes about two (out of four) scenarios underwent substantial change during the dialogue:</p><ul><li>Respecting Scenario 1 (concerning increasing public funding for the existing Canadian public health care system) the percentage of participants supporting this scenario rose from 48% at the start of the dialogues to 61% at the end of the dialogues.</li><li>Respecting Scenario 4 (concerning overhauling the primary care component of the Canadian public health care system) the share of participants supporting this scenario rose from 56% at the start to 79% at the end of the dialogues.</li></ul><p>Similarly, the reported quantitative results of the Choicework Dialogues held in connection with <a href=""http://participedia.net/cases/commonground-first-five-years-dialogue-early-childhood-new-mexico"">CommonGround: The First Five Years: A Dialogue on Early Childhood in New Mexico</a> showed that participants' beliefs about one sub-issue and participants' attitudes about one funding method had changed notably during the course of the dialogues:</p><ul><li>The percentage of participants who believed that the period from birth to five years was the most important for a child's future outcomes rose from 66% at the start of the dialogues to 85% at the end of the dialogues. </li><li>The percentage of participants who supported increasing public funding for early childhood education and development, even if that meant cutting public spending on health and public safety, dropped from 77% at the start of the dialogues to 56% at the end of the dialogues.</li></ul><p>In Choicework Dialogues involving multiple dialogue events reported results often show consistency among events respecting ranking of scenarios and funding methods and other quantitative survey results. </p><p>In terms of qualitative results reports often describe highly positive responses from participants respecting feelings of community or solidarity or feelings of having been treated with respect during the dialogue. Some reports of qualitative results of Choicework Dialogues describe participants' accounts of feeling ""transformed"" by the dialogue experience.</p><p>Several Choicework Dialogues appear to have influenced the policy decisions of the sponsoring or target organizations. For example, less than a year after the conclusion of the Choicework Dialogues held in connection with <a href=""http://participedia.net/cases/commonground-first-five-years-dialogue-early-childhood-new-mexico"">CommonGround: The First Five Years: A Dialogue on Early Childhood in New Mexico</a>, New Mexico enacted a state statute -- entitled the Early Childhood Care and Education Act [SB 120] -- that implemented several policies recommended by participants in the CommonGround dialogues.</p><p>In another example, several policy recommendations agreed by participants of the <a href=""http://participedia.net/cases/citizens-dialogue-future-health-care-canada"">Citizens' Dialogue on the Future of Health Care in Canada</a> appear to have been incorporated into the final report of the Commission on the Future of Health Care in Canada (known as the Romanow Commission), entitled <em>Building on Values: The Future of Health Care in Canada</em>.</p><p>The Choicework Dialogue method has also influenced other communication methods used for public deliberations. For example, the ""Citizen Dialogue"" method used by the Canadian Policy Research Networks to structure several Canadian public policy deliberations was based on the Choicework Dialogue method. In addition, the Choicework Dialogue method appears to have influenced the ""dialogue process"" used by EKOS Research Associates in certain public deliberations such as the Citizens’ Dialogue on Public Health Goals in Canada.</p><h3>Analysis and Criticism</h3><p>Several strengths of the Choicework Dialogue method are evident. First, Choicework Dialogues regularly produce substantial changes in participants' attitudes or beliefs respecting the issues being discussed. This indicates that the Choicework Dialogue method fosters genuine deliberation.</p><p>Second, the results of Choicework Dialogue often influence policy makers, as in the examples of  <a href=""http://participedia.net/cases/commonground-first-five-years-dialogue-early-childhood-new-mexico"">CommonGround: The First Five Years: A Dialogue on Early Childhood in New Mexico</a> and the <a href=""http://participedia.net/cases/citizens-dialogue-future-health-care-canada"">Citizens' Dialogue on the Future of Health Care in Canada</a> discussed above.</p><p>Third, the use of random sampling lends credibility to the results of Choicework Dialogues.</p><p>Fourth, in some instances where public-opinion polling has been used in connection with Choicework Dialogues, similarities and differences between the dialogue and polling results suggest that (a) as predicted, the dialogue results are representative of the broader population respecting items that were not the subject of the ""working-through"" dialogue stage; and (b) also as predicted, dialogue results differ substantially from polling results on items that participants ""worked through"" during the dialogue. These results support the view of Choicework Dialogue as a means of determining what ""informed"" public opinion on a policy issue would be given deliberation requiring respondents to consider important values and to make difficult tradeoffs.</p><p>Fifth, the Choicework Dialogue method can scale. The method has been used in single-dialogue events involving only 40 participants on a single day, as well as in nationwide dialogues consisting of ten or more events involving hundreds of participants who meet over the course of several weeks.</p><p>Sixth, Choicework Dialogue has been used successfully at many governmental levels -- including local, regional, and national levels of government -- and in multiple contexts, including citizens' public-policy deliberations and dialogues with employees of individual private businesses about intraorganizational policies.</p><p>Seventh, Choicework Dialogue can be used to address issues of great complexity and controversy, such as health care reform, early childhood education and development, land use planning, state budget reform, and nuclear waste management. </p><p>Nonetheless some criticisms of Choicework Dialogue have been expressed. Von Lieres and Kahane (2007) have criticized the Choicework Dialogue method on the grounds that political and social elites dominate the process by determining the workbook content -- including the dimensions of the issue and the relevant values to be considered and the policy and funding approaches to be weighed -- and discussion procedures. For von Lieres and Kahane (2007) this arrangement gives ordinary citizens a very small role in the process -- apart from the functions of choosing policy objectives in the ""vision of the future"" and ranking the policy and funding approaches -- and does not allow participants to reflect critically upon the deliberative process. Von Lieres and Kahane (2007) further argue that the Choicework Dialogue method does not adequately address the issues or perspectives of socially marginalized groups -- notwithstanding that those groups are represented among the participant sample in proportion to their numbers in the population -- because the workbook content and the discussion rules reflect the views and customs of the majority and/or elites.  For these reasons von Lieres and Kahane (2007) question the extent to which Choicework Dialogue method can be considered ""democratic, or deliberative, or inclusive.""</p><h3>Secondary Sources</h3><p>Canadian Policy Research Networks.

"<br /><h3>Definition</h3><p>Community organizing is a process where people who live in proximity to each other come together into an organization that acts in their shared self-interest. Unlike those who promote more-consensual community building, community organizers generally assume that social change necessarily involves conflict and social struggle in order to generate collective power for the powerless. A core goal of community organizing is to generate durable power for an organization representing the community, allowing it to influence key decision-makers on a range of issues over time. In the ideal, for example, this can get community organizing groups a place at the table before important decisions are made. Community organizers work with and develop new local leaders, facilitating coalitions and assisting in the development of campaigns.</p><p>Community organizers generally seek to build groups that are democratic in governance, open and accessible to community members, and concerned with the general health of a specific interest group, rather than the community as a whole. Organizing seeks to broadly empower community members, with the end goal of ""distributing"" power more equally throughout the community.</p><p>Community organizing is not to be confused with community development. Consensual community development efforts to improve communities through a range of strategies, usually directed by educated professionals working in government, policy, non-profit, or business organizations, is not community organizing. Community development projects increasingly include a community participation component, and often seek to empower residents of impoverished areas with skills for collaboration and job training, among others. However, community development generally assumes that groups and individuals can work together collaboratively without significant conflict or struggles over power to solve community challenges. One currently popular form is asset-based community development that seeks out existing community strengths. The relationship between community organising and community development is however more one of nuance than total difference. There is much community development literature and practice which is very similar to community organising, see for example the international Community Development Journal. And certainly since the 1970s community development practitioners have been influenced by structural analyses of inequity and power distribution.</p><p> </p><h3>History</h3><h2>History in the United States</h2><p>Robert Fisher and Peter Romanofsky have grouped the history of ""community organizing"" (also known as ""social agitation"") in the United States into four rough periods:</p><h3>1880 to 1900</h3><p>People sought to meet the pressures of rapid immigration and industrialization by organizing immigrant neighborhoods in urban centers. Since the emphasis of the reformers was mostly on building community through settlement houses and other service mechanisms, the dominant approach was what Fisher calls social work. During this period the Newsboys Strike of 1899 provided an early model of youth-led organizing.</p><h3>1900 to 1940</h3><p>During this period, much of community organizing methodology was generated in Schools of Social Work, with a particular methodological focus grounded in the philosophy of John Dewey, which focused on experience, education, and other sociological concepts. This period saw much energy coming from those critical of capitalist doctrines as well. Studs Terkel documented community organizing in the depression era, perhaps most notably that of Dorothy Day. Most organizations had a national orientation because the economic problems the nation faced did not seem possible to change at the neighborhood levels.</p><h3>1940 to 1960</h3><p>Saul Alinsky, based in Chicago, is credited with originating the term community organizer during this time period. Alinsky wrote Reveille for Radicals, published in 1946, and Rules for Radicals, published in 1971. With these books, Alinsky was the first person in America to codify key strategies and aims of community organizing. He also founded the first national community organizing training network, the Industrial Areas Foundation, subsequently led by one of his former lieutenants, Edward Chambers.</p><p>The following quotations from Reveille for Radicals (Alinsky) give a good sense of Alinsky's perspective on organizing and of his public style of engagement:</p><dl><dd><ul><li>A People's Organization is a conflict group, [and] this must be openly and fully recognized. Its sole reason in coming into being is to wage war against all evils which cause suffering and unhappiness. A People's Organization is the banding together of large numbers of men and women to fight for those rights which insure a decent way of life....</li></ul></dd></dl><dl><dd><ul><li>A People's Organization is dedicated to an eternal war. It is a war against poverty, misery, delinquency, disease, injustice, hopelessness, despair, and unhappiness. They are basically the same issues for which nations have gone to war in almost every generation.... War is not an intellectual debate, and in the war against social evils there are no rules of fair play....</li></ul></dd></dl><dl><dd><ul><li>A People's Organization lives in a world of hard reality. It lives in the midst of smashing forces, dashing struggles, sweeping cross-currents, ripping passions, conflict, confusion, seeming chaos, the hot and the cold, the squalor and the drama, which people prosaically refer to as life and students describe as ""society.""</li></ul></dd></dl><h3>1960 to present</h3><p>The civil rights movement, anti-war movements, Chicano movement, feminist movement, and gay rights movement all influenced and were influenced by ideas of neighborhood organizing. Experience with federal anti-poverty programs and the upheavals in the cities produced a thoughtful response among activists and theorists in the early 1970s that has informed activities, organizations, strategies and movements through the end of the century. Less dramatically, civic associations and neighborhood block clubs were formed all across the country to foster community spirit and civic duty, as well as provide a social outlet.</p><h4>Loss of urban communities</h4><p>During these decades, the emergence of an ongoing process of white flight, the ability of middle-class white Americans to move out of majority Black areas, and the professionalization of community organizations into 501(c)3 nonprofits, among other issues, increasingly dissolved the tight ethnic and racial communities that had been so prevalent in urban areas during the first part of the century. As a result, community organizers began to move away from efforts to mobilize existing communities and towards efforts to create community, fostering relationships between community members. While community organizers like Alinsky had long worked with churches, these trends led to an increasing focus on congregational organizing during the 1980s, as organizing groups rooted themselves in one of the few remaining broad-based community institutions. This shift also led to an increased focus on relationships among religion, faith, and social struggle.</p><h4>Emergence of national organizing support organizations</h4><p>A collection of training and support organizations for national coalitions of mostly locally governed and mostly FBCO community organizing groups were founded in the Alinsky tradition. The Industrial Areas Foundation was the first, created by Alinsky himself in 1940. The other key organizations include ACORN, PICO National Network, Direct Action and Research Training Center, and the Gamaliel Foundation. The role of the organizer in these organizations was ""professionalized"" to some extent and resources were sought so that being an organizer could be more of a long term career than a relatively brief, mostly unfunded interlude. The training provided by these national ""umbrella"" organizations helps local volunteer leaders learn a common ""language"" about organizing while seeking to expand the skills of organizers. The Midwest Academy, based in Chicago, provides week-long training in organizing nationally to organizers and leaders who are not part of these established national organizations. The Center for Third World Organizing provides training focused on ""change efforts in communities of color."" CTWO advocates a process in which those that are most impacted are leading the fight for social change. CTWO offers multiple trainings that provide the tools needed to become an effective organizer.</p><p>The distinction between an ""organizer"" who staffs a community organization and ""leaders"" who make decisions and provide the public face of their groups was increasingly standardized over these years, even in many organizations not linked to ""umbrella"" training groups as the Alinsky tradition became increasingly influential.</p><h3>Participant Selection</h3><p>Neighbourhood and community organizations are typically open to all and specifically address community members. However, informal hierarchies and exclusionary mechanism might be at work.</p><h3>Secondary Sources</h3><p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_organizing"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_organizing</a></p><h3>Notes</h3><p><cite class=""citation book"">Alinsky, Saul (1987/1946).

"<h3>Definition</h3><p>Citizen Dialogue -- also called Citizens' Dialogue -- is a public deliberation method created by <a href=""http://participedia.net/organizations/canadian-policy-research-networks"">Canadian Policy Research Networks</a>. The Citizen Dialogue method is based on <a href=""http://participedia.net/organizations/viewpoint-learning"">Viewpoint Learning</a>'s <a href=""http://participedia.net/methods/choicework-dialogue"">Choicework Dialogue</a> method. In Citizen Dialogue a randomly selected sample of approximately 20 citizens is given a workbook about a policy issue, and then meets for one or two structured and moderated sessions of a total of 8 to 12 hours in length in small groups and plenary sessions to discuss the policy issue. At the beginning and end of a Citizen Dialogue each participant completes a survey measuring the participant's attitudes about aspects of the policy issue discussed in the workbook. The final survey also contains items about the quality of the dialogue results.</p><h3>Problems and Purpose</h3><p>This participatory method is designed create a channel between citizens and political decision makers to inform the policies of the latter. The use of the workbook enables citizens to shape their political opinion about new policies. The porcess thus enables both input of lay opinion into the political process and the information of citizens of political possibilities (and impossibilities).</p><h3>History</h3><p>This participatory method was first developed as the Citizens’ Dialogue on Public Health Goals in Canada.</p><p>During the 1990s and early 2000s, Canadian public health research and government inquiries identified several problematic issues respecting public health in Canada. These problems included unequal health outcomes among Canadian citizens, the future health of Canada's children, Canadian citizens' nutrition and physical fitness, disaster preparedness and response, and environmental protection.</p><p>In the early 2000s much public debate and discussion of Canadian public health policy took place. Some notable examples of these debate and discussion were the <a href=""http://participedia.net/cases/citizens-dialogue-future-health-care-canada"">Citizens' Dialogue on the Future of Health Care in Canada</a>, the report of the Commission on the Future of Health Care (also known as <em>The Romanow Report</em>), and the 2003 Canadian First Ministers' Accord on Health Care Renewal.</p><p>In 2004 Canada's First Ministers met to consider the state of Canada's public health policies in light of the debate and discussion of the previous few years. The First Ministers issued the 2004 Canadian First Ministers' Health Accord, which called for the development of a ""pan-Canadian Public Health Strategy."" The 2004 Accord also required  ""governments"" to ""set goals and targets for improving the health status of Canadians through a collaborative process with experts.""</p><p>To obtain public input on Canadian public health goals the Public Health Agency of Canada commissioned EKOS Research Associates, <a href=""http://participedia.net/organizations/canadian-policy-research-networks-cprn"">Canadian Policy Research Networks (CPRN)</a>, and OneWorld Inc. to hold the Citizens’ Dialogue on Public Health Goals in Canada (""Citizens' Dialogue"") in 2005. During the Citizens' Dialogue, which was held in August 2005 in five locations in Canada -- in ""Vancouver, Edmonton, Toronto, Quebec City (French) and Halifax"" -- a randomly selected and representative sample of a total of 102 participants -- with approximately 20 participants meeting in each location -- met in-person and face-to-face to discuss ""public health goals for Canada."" The deliberation method used during the Citizens’ Dialogue on Public Health Goals in Canada was CPRN's <a href=""http://participedia.net/methods/citizen-dialogue"">Citizen Dialogue</a>.</p><p>After the Citizens' Dialogue had concluded a Goal Statement Working Group used the results of the Citizens' Dialogue, along with input from other consultations with Canadian citizens and experts, to develop a set of eleven draft public health goals for Canada.</p><p>In October 2005 the Goal Statement Working Group held a conference during which these eleven draft Canadian public health goals were discussed. Ten Citizens' Dialogue participants (2 from each location) attended the conference.</p><p>In October 2005 the Canadian First Ministers agreed nine Health Goals for Canada.</p><h3>Participant Selection</h3><p> </p><h3>Deliberation, Decisions, and Public Interaction</h3><p> </p><h3>Influence, Outcomes, and Effects</h3><p> </p><h3>Analysis and Criticism</h3><p> </p><h3>Secondary Sources</h3><p>Canadian Policy Research Networks.

"<h3>Definition</h3>Citizen Conferences allow for citizens to deliberate and provide policy recommendations for a government entity.  The government entity can then use these recommendations to better meet the needs of its citizens.<h3 class=""field-item even""><strong>Participants</strong></h3><p>The participants in citizen conferences are selected randomly to represent the diverse sets of opinions and demographics of a region (e.g. a State).  These participants are usually ordinary citizens, not stakeholders or professional lobbyists.  They voluntarily participate, are given a $200 honorarium post the completion of the event, and are called ""citizen advisors.""</p><p>There is a panel of experts present who have been selected by the government entity to represent a broad range of expertise on the specific sector being discussed.  And, there is a government selected moderator who aids in the deliberation portion of the event.</p><p>Finally, concerned citizens may attend to observe and make brief statements during the question-and-answer session.</p><h3>Process</h3><p>A citizen conference is a one-day event and typically lasts from 8am to 5pm.  Prior to attending, the citizen advisors are given a brochure to read that explains the purpose of the event and illustrates a set of government proposed policies or the sector (e.g. transportation) being discussed.  If the government lists proposed policies, it is because they need fine tuning and the government entity would like to know which are most important to its citizens.  If there are no proposed policies listed, the citizen conference allows for the advisors to come up with their own policies for a specific sector.</p><p>The event begins with breakfast and a question-and-answer session.  During the session, the citizen advisors are able to ask the expert panelists and concerned citizens' about the proposed policies or sector.  After the session, the concerned citizens are allowed to make brief comments to the advisors and panelists.  When there are no more comments, the citizen advisors take a lunch break.</p><p>After the lunch break, the citizen advisors head to a deliberation room (which is live streamed via a television for the panelists to observe) and start discussing their opinions on the sector, the proposed policies, and the newly absorbed information.  During this deliberation, the moderator encourages the advisors to come up with consensual policy recommendations that meet the needs of all the citizens they represent.  If necessary, the advisors may consult with the panel of experts to ask any final questions they might have.</p><p>Once the recommendations have been decided on, with the help of the moderator the advisors draft them and prepare to present them to the public and media.  All the advisors then go to a location where a press conference can be held, and one of the advisors reads aloud the recommendations.  After the recommendations have been announced to the public and media, the public and media are given time to ask the advisors questions about their opinions, policy choices, and experiences.</p><h3>Influence and Power</h3><p>Citizen conferences may or may not be linked to any type of election.  If they are not, it may be difficult to directly influence public officials.  But, it should be noted that in many cases a citizen conference is the only basis for which a government entity can clearly hear its citizens' voices.  Thus, the recommendations set forth by the advisors should persuade public officials.  If they are linked to an election, a direct influence is more expected.</p><h3>Examples</h3><p><a href=""http://participedia.net/en/cases/20072008-new-mexico-citizen-conferences-0"">2007/2008 New Mexico Citizen Conferences</a></p><h3>Secondary Sources</h3><p>1.

"<h3>Definition</h3><p>Online consultations or e-consultations refer to an exchange between government and citizens using the Internet. They are one form of <a href=""http://participedia.net/en/methods/online-deliberation"">online deliberation</a>. Further, online consultation consists in using the Internet to ask a group of people their opinion on one or more specific topics, allowing for trade-offs between participants. Generally, an agency consults a group of people to get their thoughts on an issue when a project or a policy is being developed or implemented, e.g. to identify or access options, or to evaluate ongoing activities. This enables governments to draft more citizen-centered policy.</p><p>As the Internet gains popularity with the public for voicing opinion, citizen participation in policy development through cyberspace is changing the face of democracy. The rise of the Internet has given way to buzzwords such as e-democracy, referring to citizen participation in politics, government issues and policy development through electronic technologies and the Internet, and eGovernment, pertaining to providing citizens with government information and services online. Online consultation is an element of these concepts. Through online engagement, government is enabled to hold interactive dialogues with the public as they have a more direct route to citizen opinion via the Internet.</p><p>Countries like the UK, Denmark, Scotland, Canada, the US-state California, and Australia can be considered leaders in the field. These and many other countries are integrating online consultations and engagement using various methods and for a range of purposes. The European Union also utilises online consultations. These complement face-to-face consultations and help to create greater transparency of the democratic process. Online consultations are also increasingly being used by the United Nations and its Specialized Agencies. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN hosts online consultations to allow for more inclusive drafting processes of policy guidelines, reports and strategy papers. The Global Forum on Food Security and Nutrition (FSN Forum) is tasked with carrying out many of these consultations.</p><h3>Problems and Purpose</h3><p>The problem targeted by online consultation consists of representative democracy's division of labour between the electorate and political decision makers. Government officials tend to come from a higher income, higher education strata of society. This renders insights and everyday perspectives of many citizens excluded from legislative processes.</p><p>Online consultations aim at including a wider public in legislative processes, increasing transparency of government activity, and moreover have a learning effect on participants. The main goal consists of making legislation accessible to a wider public and including insights and everyday knowledge from those affected by legislation.</p><h3>Participant Selection</h3><p>In principle, most online consultation processes are completely open to everyone who wants to participate. However, governments initiating entities have some influence in targeting certain groups in population by advertising the consultation on websites frequented by certain societal groups. Moreover, some consultation processes might be might only include certain groups, like fora for victims of rape or sexual harassment sharing their experiences in order to influence new legislation in the field.</p><h3>Deliberation, Decisions, and Public Interaction</h3><p>Deliberation mostly takes place in online fora provided by initiators. Here users can leave comments and react to the comments of others. Other quantitative features might be employed like surveys ranking preferences, or like and maybe even dislike buttons. Voting procedures between several options might also be employed.</p><h3>Influence, Outcomes, and Effects</h3><p>Online consultations, like face-to-face consultations or written petitions, are of advisory character. They are meant to inform political decision makers of the public opinion, so they can take a considered decision.</p><h3>Analysis and Lessons Learned</h3><p>Online consultations fruitfully make use of new means of online communication to make legislative processes more transparent and informed by public opinion. They can, however, be criticised from various angles.</p><p>First, while striving to include all strata of society and lowering the barrier for participation, the digital divide and digital inequalities show that the Internet might not be the right tool to do so. Several studies show that the people with higher income and education participate more than those with lower incomes and education, men more than women, young more than old, white more than those of other racial backgrounds. Thus outcomes of online consultation are heavily biased.</p><p>Second, as online consultation is only advisory, it is up to political decision makers to make the decision whether to execute outcomes of consultation or not. This might result in ""cherry picking"" with only those outcomes executed that would have been executed anyway, which implies faking participation in order to gain legitimacy.</p><h3>External Links</h3><p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_consultation"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_consultation</a></p><h3> </h3><p> </p>",en,733,Online Consultations
"Update February 2015: the e-Deliberation platform has been retired; it failed to reach escape velocity.<h3>Definition</h3><p>e-Deliberation is an online enabling technology for collaborative decision and strategy making by the persons who have the expertise or are impacted by the focus of the e-Deliberation. It provides the thinking process and platform to tie it all together.</p><h3>Problems and Purpose</h3><p>e-Deliberation targets difficult, complex or wicked problems that have multiple stakeholders each with their varied interests, preoccupations and goals. The e-Deliberation thinking process yields a multifaceted resolution which tends toward full participant consent.</p><h3>History</h3><p>e-Deliberation was adapted from the cybernetician Stafford Beer's Team Syntegrity protocol for large group deliberation. The Team Syntegrity protocol, designed for face to face conferences in the 1990's, was adapted with e-Deliberation for the online environment since 2010.</p><h3>Participant Selection</h3><p>Participants are invited to private e-Deliberation events. In public events, participants may self-select as well as be invited. A Project Manager ensures that all stakeholder groups have representation before finalizing the team of participants. </p><p>A stakeholder is anyone who is impacted or affected by the focus of the e-Deliberation. Other participants may include persons who possess useful knowledge about the knowledge domain.</p><p>Participants join the event by a certain start date/time and stay with it until it's scheduled conclusion. A full e-Deliberation event requires about 24 hours of participation spread over a number of days. There are variants of the process that require less time.</p><h3>Deliberation, Decisions, and Public Interaction</h3><p>The e-Deliberation process is described in the figure below. Depending on the nature of the outcomes sought, process variants using only sub-sections of the process can also be used.</p><p>The e-Deliberation process normally includes divergent as well as convergent thinking and  the use of sub-teams to explore various facets of the solution space (""topics""). Multiple feedback loops give sub-teams feedback on where other sub-teams are going, to assess touch points, overlaps and contradictions between topics, and to ascertain the level of consent each team's proposed resolution has garnered from the rest of the group. The participants are assigned to more than one sub-team following a logic that based on maximizing participant interest in assigned topics and ensuring a maximum interaction between all participants.</p><p>The process is consent-based, meaning that instead of striving for a full consensus, the goal is to achieve full consent, where none of the participants have paramount objections to the resolutions. Once a paramount objection is made, it belongs to the entire group to collaborate to find a solution to it.</p><p>The discussions within sub-teams are private - what is published are the proposed resolutions. The assembly and integration of all the sub-team resolutions form the team's response to the focus of the e-Deliberation event.</p><p>The interaction between participants can be mediated entirely online, or can use a mix of face to face and online if the participants are co-located and can schedule such meetings. Most often, the interaction remains entirely online using both synchronous and asynchronous interaction.</p><p><img alt=""e-Deliberation Summary Process Diagram"" height=""655"" src=""https://www.e-deliberation.com/sites/e-deliberation.com/files/e-DeliberationProcess.gif"" width=""555"" /></p><p>The e-Deliberation process can also be used to support groups meeting entirely face to face as long as they have access to the Internet as a means to share information.</p><p>The contribution of each participant is tracked using Reputation Points that recognize the various ways in which the participant can contribute to the event and the success of the team. Points are awarded for posts, ideas, responding to polls, ""liking"" someone else's post, etc.</p><p>People may sign up to an e-Deliberation event either as a Participant or as a Follower. A Follower has access to updates about the event as it progresses, but is not privy to the actual deliberations.</p><h3>Influence, Outcomes, and Effects</h3><p>An e-Deliberation event can be requested by any variety of organization type and role within that organization. Very few organizations or even communities are not confronted by problems or challenges that require a focused, multifaceted and integrated approach.  The context of use will determine the influence the outcomes of the e-Deliberation will have on decision making an implementation.</p><p>The outcome of en e-Deliberation event is a strategy articulated along several complementary but integrated facets. Complex problems can only be addressed by solutions that have the requisite level of variety. e-Deliberation delivers that.</p><p>Moreover, because the decision-making is consent-based, minority views will have had a chance to be examined, and the final outcomes will be supported by the whole team. This creates a critical mass of persons ready to defend the conclusions and support their implementation.</p><h3>Analysis and Criticism</h3><p>e-Deliberation events have a start and an end date and time, and are conducted with a given set of persons who are expected to participate throughout the whole duration of the process. The event delivers a product - the multifaceted strategy.</p><p>This approach is therefore different from online discussion forums where people can opt in and out of conversations and where there is no expected closure or conclusion.</p><h3>External Links</h3><p>The e-Deliberation™ web site: <a href=""https://www.e-deliberation.com"">https://www.e-deliberation.com</a></p><p> </p>",en,775,e-Deliberation™
"<h3><u>Definition</u></h3><p>The Pittsfield School  District discovered they needed to re-vamp their school systems. With a grant from the Nellie Mae Education Foundation they started research into how they could transform their schools. The main focus was designing a community conversation to help uncover teh underlying issues and develop possible solutions. This is the beginning of what plans to be a long-term plan of change.</p><h3><u>Problems and Purpose</u></h3><p><strong>The Pittsfield New Hampshire School District recognized that their schools, most particularly the Middle School, needed to tranforms to a student-centered learning environment that would motivate their students. They also were focused on bringing up graduation rates, college-attendance rates,</strong></p><h3><u>History</u></h3><p><strong>In December of 2010, the Pittsfield School District received a one-year planning grant from the Nellie Mae Education Foundation to support the transformation of their middle -high school from a traditional school to a student-centered learning environment. Pittsfield is the only community in New Hampshire to receive one of these highly competitive grants.</strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>Since the grant was awarded, the Community Advisory Council - which includes many community members and community educators who have volunteered - began developing a multi-year plan for this transformation. The Council researched effective educational practices and visited successful, innovative schools to learn how to better serve the students and  the community.</strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>An important component of the planning process was to involve as many Pittsfield residents as possible in assessing the current state of the schools and creating concrete recommendations for improvement over the next several years. To meet this goal, the School District decided to work with the Pittsfield Youth Workshop to design a process for engaging town residents in focused conversations about the schools and community. The PYW then partnered with NH Listens (part of the Carsey Institute at the University of New Hampshire) to help support these community-wide small group dialogues. The first rounds of those community conversations occurred in August and September, 2011. </strong></p><p> </p><p><strong><strong>To begin the project, the organizations brought together a small planning group in July to help frame the key questions to be addressed and identify some of the primary issues that were likely to come up in the conversations. This group included the staff and board leadership of PYW, members of the Community Advisory Council, school employees, parents, and community leaders. The group discussed perceptions of the community and its schools, past efforts at school improvement, and ways to strengthen the school and community in the future. In order to capture the importance of the relationship between Pittsfield and its schools, the group decided that the most appropriate framing for the small group dialogues that would be taking place in August should be: <em>Strong Schools—Strong Community; How can all of us make Pittsfield a great</em> <em>place for everyone to learn and live?</em></strong></strong></p><p> </p><p><strong><strong>The planning group also discussed the most effective way to engage as many people as possible in the community conversations, including ways to recruit residents who often don’t participate in public forums or school-related events. In order to provide input to the schools in time to be included in the next major funding proposal to the Nellie Mae Foundation, it was decided that a three-week series of small group facilitated dialogues beginning in early August would be the most effective approach.</strong></strong></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><h3><u>Participant Selection</u></h3><p><strong>PYW and the planning group recruited facilitators and participants, using a variety of strategies. </strong></p><ul><li><strong>High school students worked with PYW to design fliers to promote the community conversations and attended Pittsfield Old Home Day and National Night Out to distribute the fliers and encourage residents to sign up for the conversations. </strong></li><li><strong>PYW reached out to particular groups in the community to encourage participation, including senior citizens, current high school students and recent graduates, parents who have participated in PYW programs in the past, homeschool parents, community leaders and community members who are not generally involved in the school. </strong></li><li><strong>Phone calls were made to individual residents, announcements and articles were published in the <em>Suncook Valley Sun</em>, and notices were posted on the PYW and Pittsfield School District web site.</strong></li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>These efforts resulted in registration of over 60 participants, representing a diverse range of ages, occupations, length of residency in Pittsfield, and experience with the schools (some had children in the schools and some did not). However, between the time of recruitment and the beginning of the conversations more people did show interest in participating. In total 113 residents participated in the conversation.</strong></p><p> </p><p> </p><h3>Deliberation, Decisions, and Public Interaction</h3><p><strong>The community conversations began on July 28, 2011 at the Pittsfield Fire Station. About 30 of those oringically planning to participate attended, as well as a number of residents who had not signed up. The kick-off was also attended by the School Board and school leadership as well as representatives of the Annenberg Institute for School Reform. A total of about 50 residents participated in the kick-off. A combination of whole group and small group exercises were used to answer a set of four questions, listed below with the most common themes reported under each one. The starred (*) words were used the most often.</strong></p><p><strong><strong><em> </em></strong><em>What words would I use to describe Pittsfield schools today?</em></strong></p><ul><li><p><strong><em>small**</em></strong></p></li><li><p><strong><em>limited**</em></strong></p></li><li><p><strong><em>caring</em></strong></p></li><li><p><strong><em>improving</em></strong></p></li><li><p><strong><em>changing**</em></strong></p></li><li><p><strong><em>supportive</em></strong></p></li><li><p><strong><em>needs improvement</em></strong></p></li><li><p><strong><em>dedicated**</em></strong></p></li><li><p><strong><em>lack of communication between parents and teachers</em></strong></p></li></ul><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong><strong><em>What words would I use to describe the Pittsfield community today?</em></strong></strong></p><ul><li><p><strong><strong><em>supportive**</em></strong></strong></p></li><li><p><strong><strong><em>friendly</em></strong></strong></p></li><li><p><strong><strong><em>small**</em></strong></strong></p></li><li><p><strong><strong><em>close</em></strong></strong></p></li><li><p><strong><strong><em>active</em></strong></strong></p></li><li><p><strong><strong><em>caring**</em></strong></strong></p></li><li><p><strong>taxed</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>struggling**</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>poor**</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>shrinking</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>dedicated</strong></p></li></ul><p> </p><p><strong><strong><em>What words would I want to use to describe Pittsfield schools in five years?</em></strong></strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>successful</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>teachers stay</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>achieving**</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>proud**</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>student-centered**</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>thriving</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>innovative</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>individualized</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>communicative</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>model for other schools</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>100% of graduates all knowing their next steps</strong></p></li></ul><p><strong> </strong></p><p> </p><p><strong><strong><em>What words would I want to use to describe the Pittsfield community in five years?</em></strong></strong></p><ul><li><p><strong><em>united</em></strong></p></li><li><p><strong><strong><em>positive**</em></strong></strong></p></li><li><p><strong><strong><em>clean**</em></strong></strong></p></li><li><p><strong><strong><em>home</em></strong></strong></p></li><li><p><strong><strong><em>growing**</em></strong></strong></p></li><li><p><strong><strong><em>clost knit</em></strong></strong></p></li><li><p><strong><strong><em>lively</em></strong></strong></p></li><li><p><strong><strong><em>safe</em></strong></strong></p></li><li><p><strong><strong><em>proud**</em></strong></strong></p></li><li><p><strong><strong><em>connected</em></strong></strong></p></li><li><p><strong><em>active**</em></strong></p></li><li><p><strong><strong><em>welcoming</em></strong></strong></p></li><li><p><strong><strong><em>strong</em></strong></strong></p></li><li><p><strong><strong><em>friendly**</em></strong></strong></p></li></ul><p> </p><p><strong><strong>Overall, the themes that emerged from the Kick-Off focused on the size and demographic characteristics of the schools and community now (small, struggling, poor, changing), the community’s sense of itself and its schools now (supportive, dedicated, caring), and its aspirations for the future of the schools and community (proud, achieving, student centered, active, positive, clean, friendly).</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>Once these issues were uncovered, the conversation topics were able to be decided and the conversations could begin.</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong><strong>Five facilitated groups of 8-12 people met over a period of three weeks for two hours each week to address the framing questions.

Then all of the groups came together for a final Action Forum to determined the key findings and recommendations of all the groups. This occured on August 25, 2011 at the Pittsfield Community Center. The group decided on the main points as listed below.</p><p><strong>1. Stronger communication </strong></p><ul><li><strong>In multiple forms, including Power School, newsletters, and websites</strong></li><li><strong>W</strong><strong>ithin the school and between the school and community </strong></li><li><strong>Enhanced by surveys to elicit opinions and determine the most effective communication mechanisms </strong></li><li><strong>To include educational and service opportunities, current events in the school and community </strong></li></ul><p><strong>2. Enhanced curriculum </strong></p><ul><li><strong>Recognize a range of learning styles </strong></li><li><strong>Student-centered, enriched curriculum with more electives </strong></li><li><strong>Clear syllabi, signed by teachers and parents, to include assignments, transition plans, expectations for performance and behavior </strong></li></ul><p><strong>3.

The report was focused for the Nellie Mae Foundation, in hopes that they would fund the transformation plan over a six-year period to help the community and schools create a student-centered learning environment for Pittsfield students.</strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>This is the statement by PWY and NL Listens representative, as written in the full report presented to the Nellie Mae Foundation...</strong></p><p> </p><p><strong><em><strong>""Pittsfield is a strong community with a substantial core of dedicated, caring residents, many of whom have lived there most of their lives. There is a shared sense of duty to the community and its schools, expressed as a shared desire to see the schools improve such that more students graduate with high aspirations for continued education and career success. In order to achieve this goal, much more attention needs to be placed on innovative, creative, frequent forms of communication within the school and between the school and community. The schools need to be perceived as responsive to the community and the parents whose children attend them. Likewise, the community must be supportive of its schools through partnerships, involvement in school activities, and investment in new initiatives such as a magnet school. An ultimate goal of school improvement should be to create a strong sense of pride across all members of the community, whether they are long-time residents or newcomers who have moved here recently, affluent or not, young or old.</strong></em></strong></p><p> </p><p><strong><em><strong>With respect to the schools, there is consensus that a student-centered curriculum that exposes students to a wider range of subject matter (including the arts) and that recognizes individual learning differences is critical. Expectations for appropriate behavior must be clear and enforced. Students and parents want close, positive relationships with teachers and administrators. More experiential learning, both within the schools and in the community, is seen as desirable. Accountability on all sides is seen as a crucial ingredient of school and community strength. The transition into school, from one school to another, and at the time of graduation is a particularly important point requiring careful attention and effective processes.</strong></em></strong></p><p> </p><p><strong><em><strong>The success of the community conversations supported by PYW creates confidence that these aspirations can be attained. There was significant support for the creation of Pittsfield Listens as an on-going resource within the community to foster dialogue on challenging issues, whether related to the schools or the wider community. This will strengthen the community even further, and serve as an important source of the pride that everyone aspires to.""</strong></em></strong></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><h3>Influence, Outcomes, and Effects</h3><p>The report was given to the Nellie Mae Foundation in October of 2011. By February of 2012 the NMF and announced they would award the Pittsfield School District with a 3-year $2 Million grant in support of the transformation to student-centered learning process. The NMF also awarded the Pittsfield Youth Workshop $130,000 for their leadership in the community.</p><p> </p><p> </p><h3>Analysis and Criticism</h3><p>The Pittsfield community, the Department of Eduation of New Hampshire, and the NMF have all given high regards to the community conversations and the dedication to student achievement. Clearly the method was successful because the school was granted the grant to transform and develop their schools.</p><p> </p><h3>Secondary Sources</h3><p>Summary Report 2011 by NH Listens</p><p><a href=""http://www.education.nh.gov/news/pittsfield.htm"">http://www.education.nh.gov/news/pittsfield.htm</a></p><h3>External Links</h3><p>Youtube video of the method: ""Pittsfield School District""</p><p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCQjwkBYdhI&feature=player_embedded"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCQjwkBYdhI&feature=player_embedded</a>#!</p><p> </p><h3>Notes</h3><p> </p>",en,736,"New Hampshire Public Conversations on School Redesign and Student-centered Learning: Pittsfield, NH"

Although it is based on iteration and feedback, it is less elaborate and resource‐intensive than Deliberative Polling. In addition, unlike Deliberative Polling, the Delphi technique eschews face‐to‐face discussion in favor of repeated anonymous surveys. The rationale for removing face‐to‐face discussion from a group decision process is that group dynamics can stifle creativity, inhibit dissent, and prevent all aspects of an issue from emerging.""

"<h3>Definition</h3><p> </p><p>Les méthodes délibératives explorant les leviers de la cohésion sociale et s’adressant directement aux citoyens en les incluant dans le processus décisionnel par la consultation et la délibération, n’apparaissent pas dans la revue de la littérature académique sur la question. Les politologues et autres chercheurs en sciences-sociales, étudient et mesurent plutôt des actions participatives visibles, car « commandées par le haut », qui ciblent un public limité.</p><p>De son côté, la méthode participative SPIRAL (<em>Societal Progress Indicators for the Responsibility of All) </em>du Conseil de l’Europe (CoE), se fonde sur la lutte contre les inégalités et l’exclusion, en cherchant à activer l’optimum économique et social dans nos sociétés. Cette méthode « par le bas » est unique en son genre, car elle propose de s’adresser directement à tous les citoyens et non à des groupes déjà constitués ou à des individus « types ». Elle vise également à développer des partenariats, pour constituer une « sphère publique locale ». La méthodologie délibérative SPIRAL du Conseil de l’Europe engendre ainsi la création de groupes homogènes de citoyens, par le biais de la consultation et de la discussion, sur les notions opposées du bien-être et du mal-être. Cette démarche, permet l’élaboration d’indicateurs, qui peuvent instaurer les conditions pour atteindre le chemin du progrès sociétal.</p><p>La méthode délibérative SPIRAL, se fonde ainsi sur la définition du concept de coresponsabilité par les acteurs eux-mêmes, fabricants les indicateurs du bien-être dans une première phase consultative appelée « concertation ». Le processus consultatif se construit à l’aide de 7 étapes, qui remplissent les critères normatifs de la délibération (la rationalité, la réciprocité, l’impartialité et l’universalité). La méthodologie SPIRAL, tente également d’élaborer à l’aide de la délibération, de nouveaux instruments pour mesurer la cohésion sociale. Durant la démarche, lorsque l’on passe de la phase de concertation à l’action par l’amélioration des liens sociaux, l’étape d’opérationnalisation risque de demeurer floue et par conséquent inefficace. Ainsi, l’évaluation de la démocratie délibérative ne se limite pas à rechercher son ou ses effet(s) dans les politiques publiques. En élaborant un processus à travers les groupes de coordination, les groupes homogènes puis les groupes arc en ciel, la méthodologie SPIRAL permet de fabriquer une sphère publique locale, qui offre la possibilité de délibérer sur des problématiques actuelles, avec une possibilité de perdurer dans le temps. L’originalité de la méthode est qu’elle intègre et applique un concept évolutif : lorsque une amélioration est décelée dans la pratique (engendrant un effet multiplicateur), elle est reproduite et intégrée dans le schéma d’origine. La méthode doit ainsi pouvoir s’adapter aux changements. Les actions pilotes (plus de 1600 actions pour le « vivre ensemble » sont répertoriées à l’heure actuelle, rien que pour la Wallonie), définissent des projets cadres et sont évolutives en fonction d’une co-évaluation participative de l’impact. On peut ainsi présupposer un processus cyclique alimenté par les objectifs (cadres normatifs), les instruments (mettre en mouvement) et les cadres institutionnels (structure). </p><blockquote><p><img src=""//4C8476CB-C3EE-4A28-9C9D-458F76E3D13A/application.pdf"" /></p></blockquote><p> </p><p>SPIRAL se situe ainsi en amont des politiques publiques, pour anticiper les problèmes et inclure les citoyens à la sphère publique. Créant ainsi un cadre parallèle, cette méthode ingénieuse peut déceler des ressources et autres moyens d’action, pour « sortir des sentiers battus » de la fabrique de l’innovation sociale. L’institution intergouvernementale basée à Strasbourg, a ainsi orchestré des expériences de ce type à travers toute l’Europe et le monde (France, Belgique, Allemagne, Grèce, Italie, Pologne, Portugal, Roumanie, Fédération de Russie, Suède, de même que dans les îles du Cap-Vert et au Gabon pour l’Afrique et en Turquie pour l’Asie). Cette expérience internationale, vise à développer des territoires de coresponsabilité, transposables sur tout le continent, dans le but de créer une « société providence ». Cette nouvelle vision, où la responsabilité serait partagée entre tous les acteurs et pas seulement confiée à l’Etat, pourrait être une des réponses aux problèmes actuels d’exclusion et de hausse des inégalités. </p><h3>Problems and Purpose</h3><p> </p><p>Dans son ouvrage <em>Qu’est-ce que l’intégration</em>, Dominique Schnapper précise que l’Etat <em>welfare </em>est passé d’un système « assurantiel » (avant les chocs pétroliers des années 1970), à un système « assistantiel» et par conséquent stigmatisant. Cette position paternaliste, permettant de répondre aux faiblesses ciblées sans pour autant résoudre les problèmes de fond, doit évoluer car elle n’empêche ni les inégalités, ni les fractures sociales de croître. Au regard de la crise mondiale, force est de constater la tendance des sociétés post-industrielles, de se tourner plutôt vers « l’avarice sociale », méthode qui invite à restreindre les aides et autres subsides de l’Etat, pour ne pas perturber le marché du travail. Cette théorie, permettant de renouer avec ce que l’on appelait autrefois « l’utilitarisme » (concept développé en 1789 par le britannique Jeremy Bentham), souhaite démontrer que la société fait de son mieux pour le maximum de personnes (l’intérêt commun est la somme des intérêts particuliers) et qu’il faille accepter que le bonheur de tous n’est pas réalisable. Cette vision de la société s’oppose à celle de l’intérêt général, qui dépasse chaque individu et est en quelque sorte, au regard de la pensée éclairée du philosophe des Lumières Jean-Jacques Rousseau, « <em>l’émanation de la volonté collective des citoyens </em>». La volonté générale doit cependant intégrer les intérêts particuliers, le rôle de l’Etat devant être celui de médiateur, capable de réaliser la synthèse émanant des membres de la société civile, englobant également les intérêts des générations futures. Considérant la cohésion sociale recherchée par l’intérêt général comme étant le but ultime de l’Etat, on peut ainsi qualifier l’Etat « d’architecte du social ». Mais l’instrumentalisation des politiques publiques, empêchent en partie la machine étatique et les décideurs publics comme privés de « penser » la cohésion sociale. Robert Putnam, travaillant sur la notion de capital social (<em>Bowling Alone : The Collapse and Revival of American Community</em>, New York, 2000), décrit même un « <em>affaiblissement des structures de sociabilité et les formes d’un repli individualiste, qui entraînent un déclin de confiance entre les individus et envers les institutions </em>». Parallèlement, les acteurs politiques sont souvent en manque d’informations précises, sérieuses, organisées, structurées et même utilisables, sur les réalités de la vie quotidienne.</p><p>Pour créer de la cohésion sociale, la production de règles (ou régulation), viendrait compléter l’effort d’intégration des individus. En d’autres termes, les individus « s’incluent », plutôt que « s’intègrent » dans la « chose publique », à la fois en <em>usant</em> et en <em>créant</em> des normes sociales. C’est pourquoi, je propose à travers cet article, de rechercher l’inclusion des citoyens à travers leur participation dans la société, en forgeant les outils de la démocratie délibérative avec les fondamentaux de la cohésion sociale, lui conférant par là même, des mécanismes pour son opérationnalisation. Par ailleurs la délibération, qui ne se limite pas à une simple consultation des citoyens, doit viser la création de liens sociaux pour être efficace. En privilégiant la méthode délibérative, l’Etat permettrait aux citoyens, qui après avoir discutés et dégagés un consensus, d’élaborer leurs propres indicateurs pour participer à la politique, évitant ainsi l’instrumentalisation et la manipulation. La méthode délibérative SPIRAL du CoE, engage les citoyens qui peuvent participer à tous les cycles de progrès, permettant à partir d’échanges de point de vue, en recherchant un consensus, de produire des actions sociales pour soi et pour les autres, modifiant par là même leur <strong>attitude,</strong> leur <strong>engagement</strong> et permettant ainsi l’<strong>inclusion</strong>. Ce paradigme, serait le fondement d’une nouvelle communauté, visible à travers une sphère publique locale. Toutes les raisons que nous venons d’évoquer (refonte du partenariat Etat-société-économie, recherche de l’intérêt général, meilleure information, légitimité de l’action, participation de tous, confiance, changements dans l’attitude, l’engagement et l’inclusion), serviraient à convaincre les décideurs de compléter leur approche verticale de la cohésion sociale, par une approche visant des liens microsociaux horizontaux, entre les acteurs d’un territoire. Nous pouvons ainsi construire notre réflexion autour de la problématique suivante : <em>La méthode délibérative, est-elle adaptée pour renforcer la cohésion sociale au niveau local et régional ?</em></p><h3>History</h3><p> </p><p>Considérant que « <em>les définitions de la notion de cohésion sociale mettent en jeu les représentations qu’une société se fait d’elle-même</em> » (Guibet Lafaye 2011), force est de constater que la mondialisation et ses conséquences économiques et sociales ont modifié la structure de base de l’Etat et la vision du rapport des sociétés à la cohésion sociale. Au regard du tableau très sombre de l’architecture sociale actuelle, nous devons plus que jamais démontrer que l’intérêt du marché et plus généralement de l’économie, ne s’oppose pas à la protection des plus pauvres et des plus fragiles. C’est pourquoi, l’intégration ne doit pas se confronter d’une manière primaire aux formes d’exclusions ou autres formes de stigmatisation, mais rechercher une solidarité coresponsable en reconnaissant, à l’instar de la vision véhiculée par le CoE, que tout citoyen peut apporter sa contribution (quelle qu’elle soit) à la société, à travers des débats ou par une délibération organisée.</p><p> </p><blockquote><p align=""center""><img src=""//ED2FD1C7-67AA-4BE9-839D-5BA9271379CC/application.pdf"" /></p></blockquote><p>L’objectif de la solidarité coresponsable, serait de construire des ponts pour faire correspondre la notion de la cohésion sociale au concept, permettant ainsi une soutenabilité dans le temps. C’est pourquoi, les méthodes de démocratie participative, semblent pouvoir inspirer un engagement fort au citoyen, qui peut fabriquer du lien social, tout en nourrissant un sentiment de confiance. A ce stade, nous pourrions proposer une approche à travers celle de la « cohésion sociale durable », qui se définirait comme « <em>la capacité intrinsèque d’une société démocratique à partager le pouvoir, intégrant les générations actuelles et futures ; la recherche de l’inclusion de tous à travers une participation active, permettant de fabriquer des liens d’appartenance durable et de déterrer de nouvelles ressources </em>». C’est pourquoi, les politiques sociales doivent plus que jamais inclure tous les citoyens (ceux qui participent, ceux qui s’engagent, mais aussi les catégories fragiles, les marginaux), sans les stigmatiser. Cette réponse peut correspondre au mouvement institutionnel actuel à savoir, celui qui vise à activer un plus grand pouvoir de participation et de décision « par le bas ».</p><p>            La démocratie délibérative comme nous l’entendons aujourd’hui, a été élaborée à l’aide d’une approche socio-historique, par le philosophe allemand Jürgen Habermas  et le sociologue-historien américain Robert Sennet. Tous deux défendent l’idée que « <em>les démocraties du XXème s. doivent être érigées sur un espace public véritable et critique</em> ». Ces derniers expliquent la faiblesse du modèle démocratique dans nos sociétés actuelles, par la décadence de ce même “espace public“ et ce, dès le XIXème s, au moment des révolutions industrielles. La transformation de la société, engendrant le déclin des valeurs familiales et le développement de la culture de masse, entraînerait de la sorte l’incapacité des individus à développer un esprit critique. Ce paradigme, appelé par Habermas le « <em>fétichisme de la communauté </em>», déverrouille un mécanisme qui fait que progressivement, les individus se retrouvent déconnectés de la sphère publique. Les outils de ce mécanisme, qui forment alors le rouage de l’Etat capitaliste et industriel des XIXème et XXème siècles, passent par la bureaucratisation et la sélection par l’Etat même, de ses interlocuteurs (ce que l’on nomme aujourd’hui les corps intermédiaires).</p><p>Ainsi, la démocratie délibérative (lorsque la sphère étatique est séparée de celle des citoyens), s’exerce à travers la participation active des individus, qui constituent une « opinion publique critique ». La mobilisation et l’appropriation des questions par cette nouvelle sphère publique, s’élaborent à l’aide du fameux Principe de Discussion (dit « Principe D »), systématisé par le philosophe de l’école de Francfort : <em>«Selon l’éthique de la discussion, une norme ne peut prétendre à la validité que si toutes les personnes qui peuvent être concernées sont d’accord (ou pourraient l’être) en tant que participants à une discussion pratique sur la validité de cette norme</em>». La délibération, est ainsi perçue comme le résultat d’accords pris ensemble, tout en laissant une possibilité d’ouverture pour l’avenir. Le groupe de délibération constitué, peut résoudre des problèmes transversaux d’aujourd’hui mais aussi de demain et répondre aux critères de la cohésion sociale durable, que nous cherchons à forger. Ce système semble créer de la confiance, essentielle pour développer l’optimum économique et social. Il a été instrumentalisé par la classe politique à travers la notion du « <em>win-win »</em> (gagnant-gagnant) et utilisé pour élaborer de nouveaux dispositifs de politiques publiques.</p><p>Notre démarche est d’intégrer la délibération dans un processus de modification de la nature même de la démocratie, appelé par Loïc Blondiaux le « nouvel esprit de la démocratie », voire même « un changement de paradigme dans la manière de faire de la politique », selon Yves Sintomer et Julien Talpin.</p><h3>Participant Selection</h3><p> </p><p>SPIRAL « <em>propose un cadre, des procédures et des outils qui permettent de rendre aux citoyens et aux acteurs d’un territoire le pouvoir de qualifier le bien-être dans leur espace de vie, d’en mesurer les contours, de définir sur cette base les stratégies d’actions et de soutenir la mise en œuvre des plans d’actions locaux </em>» (Working Paper de l’IWEPS n°10). C’est pourquoi, la démarche doit s’effectuer « par le bas » : ce sont les citoyens responsables et organisés, qui sollicitent l’institution qui à son tour, fournit les outils.</p><p>Ces instruments s’intègrent dans trois ensembles :</p><p>- Transmettre les tendances de la cohésion sociale (conférences, réflexions sur le sujet).</p><p>- Elaborer des indicateurs appropriés.</p><p>- Proposer une méthode de démocratie délibérative qui permet d'échafauder des projets.</p><p>Ces dispositifs sont financés conjointement par l’Union européenne et le Conseil de l’Europe, qui a la charge d’implémenter l’ensemble. Ce partenariat entre les institutions européennes, a permis d’élaborer des indicateurs qui peuvent tous être mesurés par les Etats, se situant dans la volonté générale de sonder le bien-être de tous, une notion à la fois très étendue et très personnelle. L’originalité de la démarche est d’intégrer trois niveaux de mesure, partant du plus général pour aller vers le particulier (les capacités sociétales, les domaines de vie et les groupes vulnérables). Son objectif est bien de s’adresser à l’ensemble des individus et de rendre autant visible les catégories sociales fragiles (recherchant la justice sociale), que les tendances de la société ou encore les actions publiques. Ces trois « niveaux d’intégration », qui ont été élaborés directement par les participants, permettent de fournir des critères pour l’opérationnalisation de la cohésion sociale.</p><p>Cette originalité ne pourrait-elle pas entraîner des problèmes de fond ? « Partant du bas », la méthode SPIRAL risquerait de se heurter à une contradiction majeure, se situant entre la recherche de l’intérêt général (définit dans sa méthodologie) et la défense des intérêts particuliers (qui pourrait s’élaborer dans les groupes homogènes qui par nature, défendent leur condition) ? En effet, les citoyens à travers cette interprétation de la délibération, peuvent être amenés à privilégier leurs problèmes personnels (usage des lieux publics, problèmes liés au quartier d’habitation, à la nature du groupe homogène), plutôt que la recherche de l’intérêt général (société coresponsable), même à travers le concept universel du « bien-être pour tous dans la durée ». Ce facteur limitant, nous laisse présupposer que la transposition de la méthodologie à une strate supérieure (régionale, nationale, continentale voire mondiale), semble compliquée mais ne doit pas, à l’instar de Joseph Schumpeter dans son ouvrage <em>Capitalisme, socialisme et démocratie</em> paru en 1967, qui considérait les citoyens « ordinaires » comme étant intellectuellement limités aux questions locales, s’avérer impossible.</p><p>L’étude empirique de plusieurs communes de la région wallonne, qui appliquent cette méthode depuis quelques temps, nous permettra peut-être de confirmer ou d’infirmer les critères normatifs pour l’opérationnalisation de la délibération (attitude, engagement et inclusion). L’art.23 de la Constitution de 1994 de l’Etat fédéral de Belgique, précise « <em>l’accès de tous aux droits fondamentaux </em>». En se référant à l’indicateur de risque fabriqué par l’ Institut Wallon de l'évaluation de la prospective et de la statistique (IWEPS), on constate que « <em>par rapport à la moyenne belge, une plus grande partie de la population wallonne est exposée aux risques de pauvreté</em> ». Par ailleurs, l’approche macro-sociale qui vise à défendre les droits économiques, sociaux et culturels en Belgique est par nature incomplète, car comme nous l’avons démontré précédemment, vouloir appliquer « par le haut » les droits fondamentaux, ne suffit pas à rendre effective la cohésion sociale. Le « vivre ensemble », doit se compléter par la création de liens interrelationnels horizontaux. C’est pourquoi, dans le cadre de la « lutte contre la pauvreté et les inégalités », le gouvernement wallon avait créé en 1992 la Direction interdépartementale de la Cohésion sociale (DiCS), qui a depuis développé une démarche coordonnée tant au niveau horizontal (lien local), qu’au niveau vertical (lien régional). Cette approche, visant à défendre les droits fondamentaux de tous les citoyens wallons, est devenue effective et efficace à travers le Plan de prévention de proximité (2003-2008), auquel succèdera le Plan de cohésion sociale (PCS), d’une durée de 5 ans pour le premier volet qui se termine cette année. Dispositif d’émancipation sociale, il s’inspire du concept de cohésion sociale du Conseil de l’Europe (<em>capacité d’une société à promouvoir le bien-être de tous</em>). La méthode originale SPIRAL appliquée en Wallonie, est un outil utilisé par le Plan de cohésion sociale, qui permet de coordonner et de développer tout un ensemble d’initiatives au sein des communes, pour que chaque personne puisse vivre dignement en référence aux droits fondamentaux belges, créant par la même un « territoire de coresponsabilité ». Le premier PCS arrivant à son terme en 2013, le nouveau Plan de cohésion sociale en construction pour la période 2013-2019, recense actuellement 195 communes wallonnes de langue française, ayant répondu favorablement à l’appel de candidature lancé par la DiCS en début d’année. Ce processus dynamique, qui intéresse les communes de la région, se fonde sur un contrat entre les institutions privées, publiques et les individus, formalisé par une <em>Convention de partenariat</em>. Nous porterons une attention particulière aux 14 communes pilotes ayant participé au projet délibératif « <em>Elaboration concertée des indicateurs de bien-être en Wallonie</em> », orchestré par l’IWEPS et le CoE. Ce projet nous permettra de confronter la méthode SPIRAL aux critères normatifs de la délibération pour son opérationnalisation, qui cherche à activer la cohésion sociale au niveau local et régional. Notre approche se constituera d’une vision critique de SPIRAL, cherchant à vérifier :</p><p>• D’une part, si la délibération permet de créer des liens sociaux.</p><p>• D’autre part, si ces liens sont dynamiques, à travers les différents « niveaux » de cohésion sociale que nous avons définis précédemment. </p><h3>Deliberation, Decisions, and Public Interaction</h3><p> </p><p>Après avoir répertorié 100 groupes homogènes issus de 14 groupes de coordination (ou commission d’accompagnement) et archivés sur le site wikispiral.org, on peut réaliser une classification, à l’aide du nom qu’ils se sont attribués ; il est utile de rappeler que la nature des groupes de délibération, se constituent d’une manière totalement libre sur le territoire à l’aide d’une démarche « par le bas ». Ainsi, ces groupes homogènes peuvent être réparti en fonction des trois niveaux de cohésion sociale définis par le CoE pour une société inclusive :</p><p>- « <strong><em>Les groupes vulnérables »</em></strong>, définis dans le guide méthodologique de 2005 du CoE comme étant : les « minorités », les « migrants », les « enfants », les « personnes âgées », les « personnes handicapées », les « femmes ».</p><p>- « <strong><em>Les domaines de vie »</em></strong> indiqués par « l’emploi et les activités », « le revenu et pouvoir d’achat, » « le logement et cadre de vie », « la santé », « la nutrition », « l’éducation », « l’information », « la culture ».</p><p>- La base, formée par « <strong><em>les capacités sociétales »,</em></strong> marque la tendance pour : « assurer l’équité (droits fondamentaux) », « assurer la dignité et la reconnaissance de la diversité », « l’autonomie et le développement personnel », « la participation et l’engagement ».</p><p><img src=""//E939B0F1-6071-4F7D-BA7C-77C38A5A6ADC/application.pdf"" /></p><p> </p><p>Confrontons les 100 groupes homogènes de Wallonie, en fonction des trois niveaux de la cohésion sociale :</p><p><img src=""//EC806263-07C7-4265-9709-898DFF9AC6E4/application.pdf"" /></p><p> </p><p>Les groupes représentant les « capacités sociétales » sont les moins nombreux (15%). Les « groupes vulnérables », représentent quant à eux 23% de l’ensemble et les « domaines de vie », sont les groupes homogènes les plus représentés avec 55%. Les résultats nous permettent de constater une surreprésentation des groupes liés par « domaines de vie », que l’on peut qualifier de « catégorie la plus individuelle ». De par cette typologie, nous pouvons confirmer que pour l’ensemble des 14 communes pilotes, la constitution d’un « espace public local » est effectif : les trois sphères de la cohésion sociale sont ainsi représentés. On constate néanmoins une tendance à la reproduction du schéma sociétal individualiste à travers la répartition des groupes, qui démontre une prédisposition à vouloir délibérer sur la sphère privée (rapport à la société, domaines de vie). Néanmoins, l’activation d’une sphère publique au niveau local, permet déjà de relayer les revendications des acteurs de la communauté, qui s’inscrivent dans leur rapport à l’Etat, la société ou l’économie. Les participants devraient alors pouvoir fabriquer de la cohésion sociale, en usant et en créant de nouvelles normes sociales. Partant de ce constat, nous allons tester la méthode au regard des critères pour son opérationnalisation.</p><p>            Pour être légitime, la délibération doit à tout prix rechercher l’intérêt général, pouvant s’appuyer sur des intérêts individuels et/ou communautaires, qui doivent cependant demeurer minoritaires. La délibération fonctionne, quand elle permet d’activer une nouvelle sphère publique, entretenant un partenariat entre l’Etat, l’économie et la société. C’est pourquoi, la recherche de l’intérêt général de même que l’inclusion de tous (générations futures comprises), sont les deux concepts fondamentaux, pouvant rendre la délibération effective et génératrice de liens sociaux, dans une « société providence » qui structure la « démocratie forte ». Au regard de ces informations, émettons l’hypothèse que la délibération SPIRAL permet de dégager une attitude qui viserait l’intérêt général, concédant alors un engagement au sein de la communauté et permettant d’atteindre une inclusion au niveau du territoire local, voire même régional.</p><p><img src=""//3E687285-5A0E-4163-809B-E498F300D03D/application.pdf"" /></p><p> </p><p><em>- Les liens personnels : <strong>l’attitude.</strong></em></p><p>L’attitude dans la participation, touche ainsi les liens personnels et la sphère intime : nous appellerons ceci le <em>1er niveau de cohésion sociale</em>. L’attitude du participant doit contribuer à définir les critères du « <em>citoyen vertueux </em>», qui engage des normes, des valeurs, des initiatives, des souhaits, dans la société qu’il observe et qu’il rêve. Testons cette théorie au regard du <em>premier niveau de cohésion sociale</em>, qui se retrouve dans la famille n°8 de la nomenclature SPIRAL, représentant 16% de l’ensemble des 16.000 critères du bien-être élaborés à travers les 14 communes pilotes (<em>Les indicateurs sont construits à partir des expressions de bien-être et de mal-être recueillies auprès des citoyens, rassemblées et structurées au sein d’une nomenclature organisée en huit familles : 1) les moyens de vie ; 2) le cadre de vie et environnement ; 3) les relations avec les institutions (publiques et privées) ; 4) les relations personnelles ; 5) les équilibres sociétaux ; 6) les équilibres personnels ; 7) les sentiments de bien/mal-être ; 8/ les valeurs / attitudes et les initiatives / engagements). </em>Ces critères, que nous pouvons retrouvés sur le site du CoE wikispiral.org, nous permettent d’étudier la fréquence des indicateurs liés à l’attitude du « citoyen vertueux ». Dans un premier temps, ces indicateurs vont être classés en fonction de leurs objectifs, visant soit des intérêts particuliers, ou alors l’intérêt général. Cette approche est fondamentale pour tenter de déterminer la légitimité et la cohérence de la démarche SPIRAL, qui se définit comme étant coresponsable.</p><p><img src=""//AA84EDA0-144A-4243-96BA-0D81B9312C15/application.pdf"" /></p><p> </p><p>Les critères ne relèvent pas tous d’un même « niveau d’efficacité », pour fabriquer des liens sociaux. Ainsi, <strong>l’attitude la plus individuelle</strong> comme, « <em>le travail sur soi/ respect de soi</em> », (Exemple de critères exprimés : « <em>prendre le temps de s’écouter, apprendre à se connaître et se respecter, ne pas placer la barre trop haut, relativiser certains problèmes »)</em>, de même que les « <em>activités et initiatives privées</em> », (Exemple de critères exprimés : se donner des moyens, me lancer dans de nouveaux projets, réserver du temps pour ma famille et pour moi, se rééduquer, utiliser mon expérience, mon savoir-faire »), permettent de créer un terrain propice à la cohésion sociale, mais s’inscrivent dans une démarche « individualiste » de recherche du bien-être pour soi, ou éventuellement pour sa famille et ses proches. A l’inverse, en observant le critère H07, « <em>dynamique, volonté collective </em>», (Exemple de critères exprimés : « <em>rester solidaire pour maintenir des acquis, investir dans les nouvelles technologies, penser aux générations futures du point de vue environnemental, penser au développement durable »), </em>on constate alors un niveau de coresponsabilité, de durabilité, et de solidarité optimal, visant l’intérêt général. Ces exemples, placés aux « antipodes » (H01 et H07), sont révélateurs de <strong>l’attitude visant à rechercher le bien-être pour soi</strong> et <strong>le bien-être pour tous</strong>. La fréquence des critères de la famille H, exprimée par catégorie (H01 à H07), pourrait nous permettre de dégager une dominante voire même une déclinaison de l’attitude, pour évaluer son aspect qualitatif. A l’aide du moteur de recherche fourni par le site wikispiral.org, nous avons relevé et classifié au total 2491 critères, à propos de la démarche sur le bien-être, émanant des 13 groupes de coordination de Wallonie (les indicateurs élaborés par le groupe de coordination de Braine l’Alleud ne sont pas encore disponibles). Nous pouvons désormais engager, parmi les 7 indicateurs figurant dans la famille H (<em>valeurs / attitudes et les initiatives / engagements</em>), <strong>642 critères</strong> qui établissent une attitude visant le bien-être personnel et par conséquent des <strong>intérêts particuliers </strong>(H01-H02) et <strong>1849</strong> (H03-H04-HO5-HO6-H07) qui visent <strong>l’intérêt général</strong>, au regard d’une attitude vertueuse sur le bien-être de tous.</p><p><img src=""//F84CA161-38D7-4FAC-BFF2-D1896C9389FB/application.pdf"" /></p><p> </p><p>On constate que la recherche du bien commun par les participants, est une tendance largement majoritaire avec environ ¾ des critères se rangeant dans cette catégorie. Cette information permet de dégager le caractère « universel » de l’attitude des participants, qui recherchent l’intérêt général, permettant de légitimer la démarche. Affinons néanmoins celle-ci, en observant ce qui se passe, lorsque l’on réparti les critères en fonction des sept indicateurs de la famille H :</p><p><img src=""//6D72079E-C9D7-489F-B799-15993EAFD7C4/application.pdf"" /></p><p> </p><p><em>- Les liens communautaires : participation par <strong>l’engagement.</strong></em></p><p>L’engagement sur le terrain active des liens communautaires et le <em>2e niveau de cohésion sociale</em>. Ce niveau permet aux participants de se confronter au « <em>temps de la démocratie </em>» et autres problématiques des partenaires de notre « nouvelle sphère publique locale ». On peut supposer que ce <em>2e niveau de cohésion sociale</em> créera des liens entre les différents partenaires et acteurs du territoire coresponsable à travers les groupes arc-en-ciel, que nous analyserons au travers des effets leviers et multiplicateurs recherchés. Adrien Fiévet, chef du PCS de Liège, nous mets en garde lors d’un entretien téléphonique, au regard de son expérience sur le terrain, du possible désintéressement des citoyens après la première phase de cohésion sociale : « <em>Il faut faire attention avec cette démarche : les citoyens disent on me donne la parole, j’ai relevé le problème et vous (la municipalité) ne faites rien. Ce n’est pas de la démocratie délibérative : on relève le problème dans le quartier, on active le principe de coresponsabilité, de participation et de crédibilité des actions en mettant les gens autour de la table. Les solutions passent par une action commune y compris avec les autorités communales. Trouver une réponse collective à un problème local. Tout ce processus se construit et prend des mois : il faut sensibiliser les individus. C’est un travail compliqué qui demande de l’expérience, une bonne connaissance des gens. Il faut trouver les bons relais dans la population. Le temps de la démocratie n’est pas connu par la population : c’est une procédure très longue (la création d’un passage piéton nécessite d’importantes démarches qui consistent à contacter le service de l’urbanisme, le conseil communal, dans le cadre des réglementations en vigueur et peut parfois prendre 6 mois) ».</em> Le citoyen, après avoir dégagé une attitude propice à créer du lien social, doit alors se confronter à l’engagement, pour faire correspondre sa parole à ses actes et ainsi tester l’application de ses idées. Cette phase, peut ainsi s’opérationnaliser à travers des actions types, créant des liens entre les personnes, mais aussi avec l’Etat et le monde économique. Les critères de pluralité des groupes qui s’engagent (effets leviers), de même que l’impact externe des actions (effets multiplicateurs), établis par le monde académique et souhaités par le CoE, sont les critères normatifs, pour que cette phase soit effective en terme de création du lien social communautaire.</p><p>•<em>Les effets leviers et leurs limites : activer le partenariat.</em></p><p>A travers l’engagement des participants-délibérants, les liens entre le social et l’économie sont mis à l’épreuve et permettent d’activer « l’effet levier ». Pour Samuel Thirion, de la division de la cohésion sociale du CoE : <em>« C’est clair que lorsque l’on parle de cohésion sociale on a un impact sur l’économie. On ne peut pas séparer le social et l’économie. C’est le cas quand on améliore la situation d’une personne en phase d’exclusion, qui a perdu sa place dans la société, qu’on lui retrouve une place soit par une activité non-rémunérée ou un emploi. (…) Une approche de coresponsabilité permet de toucher des ressources qui dans une approche de marché classique ne sont pas « touchables », car ceux qui les ont ne les mettent pas à disposition, parce que on les utilise que pour une seule chose. Par exemple le covoiturage, le taxi social, l’utilisation des espaces libres pour en faire des jardins partagés, la récupération de tous les surplus agricoles jetés à la poubelle pour les redistribuer, la récupération des médicaments (en Grèce existe une pharmacie sociale qui récupère les médicaments chez les gens)</em> ». L’effet levier, permet ainsi de dégager de nouvelles ressources qui étaient alors insoupçonnables, grâce à l’engagement des différents groupes de citoyens qui trouvent des solutions, en utilisant leur complémentarité. Cette phase, peut permettre de créer des liens sociaux, entre des groupes qui ne se seraient peut-être jamais rencontrés et déterre de nouvelles ressources, qui peuvent se trouver en dehors des circuits économiques et sociaux classiques. Les ressources dégagées, doivent cependant être utilisées à bon escient, à l’aide d’indicateurs précis et complémentaires : «  <em>Il importe de ne pas confondre la population et le territoire. La concentration de moyens sur les territoires de faible niveau socio-économique peut bénéficier très inégalement aux différentes catégories de population qu’opposent souvent des intérêts contradictoires. A défaut de régulations adéquates du marché du logement, l’utilisation de ces moyens pour améliorer les espaces publics et le bâti peut conduire à des hausses de prix et compromettre le maintien sur place des habitants socio-économiquement les plus fragiles, ou induire une dégradation de leurs conditions de vie en termes de logement ou de sociabilité. Or de telles stratégies, axées sur les partenariats public-privé, et sans contrainte quant aux destinataires des logements produits, tendent à prendre le pas en Wallonie sur les anciennes approches endogènes intégrées </em>» (Diagnostic territorial de la Wallonie 2010, p.42). Les limites des effets leviers, sont ainsi clairement exposées à travers cet exemple. Pour ne pas s’éloigner de l’intérêt général (bien être de tous), les actions doivent continuellement adopter une démarche inclusive et de ce fait, intégrer les conséquences éventuelles des actions, à l’encontre des catégories sociales fragiles, en fonction du territoire. Rappelons que ce que l’on mesure, c’est que l’on cherche à atteindre.</p><p>•<em>Les effets multiplicateurs.</em></p><p>L’ensemble des actions a été répertorié dans le Rapport de la DiCS de 2010, relevant «<em> 140 plans de cohésion sociale qui regroupent plus de 1600 actions au travers de quatre axes</em> ». Ces actions, sont ainsi directement liées au plan de cohésion sociale, mais la nature des liens entre les délibérations au sein des groupes homogènes et les concrétisations sur le terrain en terme de cohésion sociale, sont très difficiles à établir. Les effets leviers et multiplicateurs, ne visent pas un processus linéaire jugé réducteur, qui a tout de même l’avantage d’être visible et plus facilement mesurable (approche choisie par les politiques publiques). La démarche SPIRAL (la bien nommée), cherche à inspirer de nouvelles actions, à l’aide d’innovations sociales déjà existantes. Notons une progression notable des actions de l’Axe 1, touchant les « <em>aides à la recherche de l’emploi »</em> (environ +22%) et la « <em>réinsertion socioprofessionnelle </em>» (environ +28%). Les trois autres axes ne relèvent pas de progrès significatifs. Nous pouvons préciser qu’un rapport pour 2013, doit être bientôt rendu public et marquera un nouveau bilan pour le premier cycle complet des PCS. Cette mesure régulière est indispensable, car comme nous l’avons démontré précédemment, elle doit permettre d’évaluer les impacts et vérifier si ces démarches, sont belles et bien inclusives.</p><p><em>- Les liens d’un territoire coresponsable : <strong>l’inclusion.</strong></em></p><p>« <em>A toute échelle, une faible hétérogénéité territoriale peut toujours coexister avec de fortes inégalités sociales à une échelle plus fine. La réduction des écarts entre les niveaux socio-économiques des territoires ne peut donc être confondue avec la réduction des inégalités sociales </em>» (Diagnostic territorial de la Wallonie 2010, p.40).</p><p>L’inclusion est le <em>dernier niveau de cohésion sociale</em>. Cette étape cherche à positionner des actions directrices (minimiser les inégalités, éviter la polarisation, coresponsabilité des acteurs), pour toucher tous les individus et viser ainsi ce que l’on nomme l’inclusion. Ce niveau met en avant les difficultés particulières qui diffèrent selon l’espace territorial concerné (urbain, semi-rural, rural) en faisant se rencontrer tous les acteurs de la sphère publique ou du moins leurs représentants connus. La rencontre <em>Responding Together</em> financée conjointement par le CoE et l’UE qui s’est tenue à Namur au début de l’année 2013, s’est donnée pour objectif de faire connaître à tous les principaux représentants des PCS de Wallonie, les actions sur le terrain permettant de redéfinir les critères d’inclusion. Trois actions « symboles » peuvent être utilisées, pour rendre explicite l’inclusion qui place le <em>3e niveau de la cohésion sociale</em> :</p><p><em>•L’action pour le logement dans l’espace urbain dense.</em></p><p><em>•L’espace semi-rural</em> et le projet « Jardin solidaire ».</p><p><em>•L’espace rural isolé </em>incluant peu de services publics et l’initiative du « Taxi social ».</p><p>Finalement, l’inclusion n’est pas uniquement conditionnée par des ressources économiques, même si ces dernières jouent un rôle majeur. Dans cette dernière étape, le citoyen participe à la vie de la communauté. Il faut tout de même rester vigilant quant à la reproduction et la pérennité de la démarche, surtout dans un contexte de plus en plus difficile : «  <em>Les catégories sociales les plus précarisées tendent à rester sous-représentées dans les mécanismes participatifs. Le développement territorial est un des domaines où la participation citoyenne est traditionnellement sollicitée. Selon la charte de Leipzig, «l’échelle du quartier est celle permettant l’implication la plus importante des habitants ». Toutefois les structures de participation institutionnalisées (enquêtes publiques, réunions, commissions locales, etc.) sont en fréquent décalage avec la culture des groupes les plus faibles</em> » (Diagnostic teritorial de la Wallonie 2010, p.44). Au regard de ces nouvelles fabriques de l’innovation sociale, on constate que la délibération engendre toujours la création de normes (« Règles pour la colocation », « charte pour les jardins partagés », « règlement établissant un niveau de priorité pour le taxi social ») sans quoi, l’action ne peut perdurer. Ainsi, la délibération créant des liens sociaux semble fonctionner au niveau local voire régional, mais doit être intégrée dans une dimension plus large (un nouvel esprit de la démocratie), pour toucher plus de personnes et permettre un « effet retour ». </p><blockquote><p><img src=""//6FB75F5D-F296-46BF-A457-0A547A8A0B18/application.pdf"" /></p></blockquote><p> </p><p>Les participants des groupes de délibération, en cherchant <strong>l’inclusion</strong> et en utilisant leurs différences comme une force, ont intégré une attitude qui les a <strong>affecté </strong>dans leur rapport aux autres. Ce triptyque, confère aux citoyens une <strong>opportunité d’influencer les politiques</strong> et de récupérer du pouvoir dans le processus décisionnel.</p><p> </p><h3>Influence, Outcomes, and Effects</h3><p> </p><p>Le diagnostique de cohésion sociale, est un dispositif du PCS ayant coordonné la concertation des acteurs locaux. Florence Gesnot, travaillant pour la cellule en charge de l’évaluation du PCS à la DiCS de Wallonie, s’exprime sur le projet lors d’un entretien téléphonique daté de mai 2013 : « <em>C’est une évaluation multiple et non une évaluation type statistiques. L’Université de Liège, est chargée d’évaluer le PCS d’une manière globale ; le CoE, est chargé de réaliser une évaluation de l’impact du PCS. L’évaluation se fait à travers une méthode de co-évaluation participative à l’aide de réalisation de tables rondes entre bénéficiaires (les citoyens) et partenaires (services associatifs, chefs de projets), d’une même action au sein des PCS locaux (…) A ce stade de l’évaluation, 63% des chefs de projet estiment que la situation {en terme de bien-être} a fortement évolué dans la commune </em>». Le diagnostique de cohésion sociale réalisé par les acteurs locaux, recense les initiatives publiques et privées déjà mises en œuvre sur le territoire communal, les attentes de la population et les manques à satisfaire, au regard des objectifs du plan. Rappelons que la nouvelle stratégie du CoE en terme de cohésion sociale élaboré en 2010, vise la « justice sociale », la « sécurité démocratique » et le « développement durable ».</p><p>C’est pourquoi, toute démocratie doit tendre vers un équilibre entre l’optimum économique et social. Cet équilibre (ou <strong>justice sociale</strong>), est possible en recherchant l’application de la cohésion sociale, qui se pratique au plus près de la population c’est-à-dire au niveau local ; visant à développer des liens sociaux, pour combattre l’anomie sociale et l’insécurité, très présentes dans nos sociétés post-industrielles. La participation, à travers la consultation et la délibération active des citoyens, permet de développer des qualités ciblées à travers l’attitude, l’engagement et l’inclusion et combattent l’individualisme. Ce nouvel état d’esprit, permet d’amasser un capital social : les performances de la société, en terme de <strong>sécurité</strong> sont alors améliorées et la confiance, plateforme communicationnelle (ou <em>Hub</em>) de toute action, peut se développer. Cette confiance retrouvée, doit alors viser ce que l’on désigne comme l’intérêt général, ligne directrice pour atteindre le <strong>développement durable</strong>, qui fixe une prochaine spirale, intégrant un nouvel équilibre entre l’optimum économique, social et cette fois-ci environnemental. Ce processus, pourrait ainsi nourrir nos régimes fondés sur la « démocratie représentative », réduisant ses effets négatifs pour relativiser, ce qu’Aristote, en dissertant sur la <em>Politeia</em> (notion liant la citoyenneté au mode d’organisation de la cité-Etat ou <em>Polis</em>), désignait comme étant « <em>le moins mauvais des mauvais régimes</em> ».</p><blockquote><p><img src=""//43906ABD-3674-4140-9B02-2BE061A055A5/application.pdf"" /></p></blockquote><p> </p><h3>Analysis and Criticism</h3><p> </p><p>Le capital social, qui synthétise la solidarité coresponsable englobe trois niveaux : les <strong>individus</strong>, au sens affectif et pragmatique, l’<strong>Etat</strong>, au sens durkheimien du terme et enfin celui de la <strong>communauté durable</strong>, qui consiste à redéfinir une véritable architecture sociale et inclusive. Le développement durable, recherchant un équilibre dans l’écoumène (que l’on peut définir comme « l’ensemble des terres habitées par l’Homme »), semble pouvoir constituer la base du projet, permettant d’atteindre des valeurs universelles. Pour dégager un consensus et légitimer ses actions, la communauté durable doit ainsi utiliser l’outil délibératif, qui semble être un instrument pouvant créer du lien social. Ainsi, pour que ce processus ne demeure pas à la marge des actions publiques, il est nécessaire d’intégrer les procédures pour le « vivre ensemble » à la réalité du terrain.</p><p>Ce projet, pourrait-il malgré tout servir de modèle pour l’Europe ?</p><p>La démarche actuelle de l’UE, est d’associer son approche <em>top down</em> à la nécessité de se lier aux communautés. C’est pourquoi, elle s’engage dans de nombreux projets et notamment dans les actions implémentées par le CoE. Avec SPIRAL, la démarche provient obligatoirement « d’en bas », car ce sont les individus ou autres institutions, qui sont toujours les « lanceurs de projets ».</p><p>Au regard des résultats dégagés à l’aide de ce travail, pourrait-on envisager de transposer la méthode SPIRAL en dehors du territoire de la Wallonie, tout en préservant son caractère efficace et englobant ?</p><p>Dans un premier temps, force est de constater que cette approche est une réussite au regard des nombreuses actions, en raison de facteurs internes. La Belgique, est un Etat qui semble être fracturé sur l’échelle nationale, entre deux communautés en conflit permanent (l’absence de consensus politique, avait entraîné il y a quelques temps une vacance du pouvoir politique pendant près d’un an). Cet exemple, démontre un sentiment communautaire fort sur l’échelle régionale, provenant de cette fracture nationale.</p><p>L’inclusion effective en Wallonie, pourrait-elle se transposer vers un autre niveau territorial plus complexe, comme la Grande Région (qui réunie Lorraine, Sarre et Rhénanie-Palatinat, Luxembourg et Wallonie), par exemple ?</p><p>Force est de constater que la méthode du CoE fonctionne en Wallonie, car l’effort est réparti entre un ensemble de partenaires indépendants et solidaires. Ce qui doit encore être démontré, réside dans l’étude des liens entre les différentes localités du territoire. La nouvelle démarche du CoE et de la Commission européenne associée au projet <a href=""https://respondingtogether.wikispiral.org/tiki-index.php?page=respondingtogether&structure=Responding&page_ref_id=390""><em>Responding Together</em></a>, permettant aux différents protagonistes des Plans de cohésion sociale de Wallonie d’échanger leurs expériences, va dans ce sens. Nous devons ainsi nous demander si cet effort, serait réalisable dans d’autres pays, avec une lourdeur bureaucratique plus forte et une pratique politique de la répartition des actions moins efficace, comme en France par exemple ? Cette étude, a simplement démontré la possibilité de création de liens sociaux sur un territoire, ayant au préalable une unité administrative, culturelle et linguistique. Rappelons que le CoE n’a pas une fonction centrale dans les relations de pouvoir en Europe. C’est pourquoi, nous pouvons supposer que les raisons majeures, empêchant le développement de la démocratie délibérative, pourraient se trouver ailleurs.</p><p>Alexis de Tocqueville, éblouit par la démocratie étasunienne alors en construction, nous éclairait en son temps sur les enjeux du pouvoir : « <em>L’homme du peuple qui est appelé au gouvernement de la société conçoit une certaine estime de lui-même. Comme il est alors une puissance, des intelligences très-éclairées se mettent au service de la sienne. On s’adresse sans cesse à lui pour s’en faire un appui, et en cherchant à le tromper de mille manières différentes, on l’éclaire </em>».</p><h3>Secondary Sources</h3><p> </p><p>Bailo, P. & Meynier, D., 2011. <em>De la solidarité économique et sociale à la cohésion territoriale - ENA, Ecole nationale d’administration</em> ENA., Strasbourg.</p><p>Bernard, P., 1999.

"<h3>Introduction</h3><p>Since the emergence of the so called Web2.0, internet technologies have greatly expanded the possibilities for people to interact and discuss; but how many times have we found ourselves trapped in endless debates about everyday facts? Social networks have greatly contributed in re-shaping the idea of online interactions, but their outcomes are, most of the time, a clashing chorus of lonely voices unable to listen to each other giving rise to unfruitful exchanges of ideas. From this point of view, web-mediated interactions are still far from being efficient means of communication, confrontation and, in the end, a means for effective decision making. It’s from the analysis of current practices in online interactions that we came up with the idea of Deebase: a CMS aimed at supporting communities in fostering the exchange of ideas among their members, turning chaotic interactions into full-fledged debates. In Deebase, members of a community -whether pre-existing or newly emerging- can engage in online discussions about specific themes, compare their ideas with those of others, rank them and finally vote for their favorite ones. The whole process is supported by the use of gamification techniques which should, on the one hand, improve users’ engagement while on the other hand transform the confrontation as a deliberate act into an exciting game-like process. In developing Deebase we have envisaged three potential targets which could benefit from the adoption of the platform: online communities, private companies and public administrations.</p><h3> </h3><h3>What is Deebase</h3><p>Good ideas are not produced by any sort of linear process, rather they emerge from the sparse, unpredictable and sometimes harsh confrontation between people. It’s during this chaotic process that people come up with big ideas, pieces of knowledge shaped by the collective contributions of all the participants interacting. But because of its complex nature, the outcomes of such confrontations are as valuable as unpredictable. Can you imagine how cool it would be to master this chaotic process and use it as a mean for solving tricky problems? It was from this question that we came up with the idea of Deebase, an online platform aimed at supporting online deliberative processes, harnessing the collective creativity springing up from online interactions. Let’s begin defining what we mean with the term deliberation. The deliberative process is very different from the decision process; the difference between deliberation and decision is fundamental but often overlooked and the two terms are considered interchangeable. Deliberation is a complex process in which ideas are generated, mixed, compared, measured, tested and finally voted. Deliberation is, first of all, an act of collective creativity in which everyone, often unconsciously, plays a fundamental role. When dealing with deliberative processes we are not primarily interested in solving the problem of how to choose the best answer among a set of pre-defined alternatives. Rather, our main interest in is in finding-out how individuals, groups, communities come to imagine alternative routes to navigate the future. But how can a web-platform facilitate online deliberative processes? Deebase allows users to express their ideas about an issue to be analyzed, facilitates the comparison between different ideas and finally lets the audience decide which is the best answer addressing the topic under evaluation. The whole process is bounded by a set of rules perfectly balanced to preserve the complexity of multiple interactions while allowing community managers to master them. An underlying Gamification system incentivizes users to express, defend and explain their ideas to other participants, rewarding them with badges and point attesting their expertise in different subjects. The whole discussion and deliberation process can also be propelled beyond the border of the platform thanks to the integration of Deebase with major social networks. In this manner Deebase can identify, for each issue, the most supported ideas, their social footprints and also keep track of opinion movements over time. At the end of each deliberation process, community managers can access both quantitative and qualitative data generated by users, allowing them to perform analysis aimed at better comprehend which are the most popular ideas in their communities and why. </p><p> </p><h3>Target users</h3><p>Who can use Deebase? The potential applications of the platform are many, in the following paragraph we’ll try to explain how online communities, private companies and public administration could enhance their effectiveness adopting Deebase. Let’s start with online communities, whether new or pre-existing. A community -for instance the readers of a popular online newspaper- could use Deebase to stimulate discussions around daily news in a more structured way than in traditional discussion boards. Structuring discussions according to the Deebase deliberative scheme would allow community managers and editors to have a clear view about readers’ reactions to articles published by the journal. This could help editors in understanding the journal’s audience, elaborate real time statistics and use data generated by the platform to further stimulate the debate around the discussed topics. But Deebase can find application also in different settings such as private companies and Public Administrations. In the first case the platform, thanks to its deliberative function, can be used as a decision-making support tool, stimulating the debate among employee in a semi-informal web environment. From this standpoint Deebase can merge the richness of the bottom-up approach, made of numerous, unpredictable and otherwise imperceptible relations, with the efficiency of the top-down approach. As an example, a company could adopt Deebase as an internal tool aimed at collecting innovative ideas about new products to be developed or new production processes to be adopted. Finally, Public Administrations could use Deebase a new means of communication between Local Government agencies and citizens. Thanks to its deliberative function, intimately integrated with social networks, Deebase could become a useful tool for policy makers willing to test the power of participative policy-design. For instance, a City Council could use Deebase not just as a tool for spotting problems and areas of interventions -a function already performed by polls- but also as a mean for identifying solutions to the identified issues, crowdsourcing knowledge from citizens.</p><h3>How it works & Technical details</h3><p>Driven by the idea of creating new modalities of online interactions, we envisioned a very easy to use web-platform for e-deliberation. The whole process begins with a question which addresses an issue to be collectively debated. Members of the community can join the platform and submit a proposal about how they would proceed in order to solve the issue. Once joined the debate, a user can:</p><ol><li>interact with the already expressed ideas, extending them</li><li>add new ideas competing with the ones already expressed or</li><li>simply cast their vote for an already expressed opinion without adding further elements to the discussion.</li></ol><p>Support to an idea can be expressed through the internal voting system or through social signals; thanks to the integration of Deebase with major social networks, people can support an idea simply sharing it on Facebook, Twitter or Google Plus. This can also contribute in extending the outreach of the discussion beyond the boundaries of the platform triggering a viral effect on social networks -which means more participation and more hype around the discussion topic. At the end of each “challenge” -all questions are time limited- the most supported opinion is elected as the winning one. In this manner it is possible to identify for each issue the most supported solution, its popularity across major social networks, the main “reasons why” behind the winning (and also the non-winning) ideas. Accordingly, users taking part in the debate are rewarded according to their contribution to the discussion. The reward system, based on points and badges, on one side keeps users engaged in the platform, on the other allows community managers to identify top contributors and influencers. All data generated by the platform can be exported and further analyzed by community managers allowing them to understand who are the members of their community, which are the most popular ideas, who are the influencers, how opinion movements generate and evolve over time. Technically speaking, the platform will be distributed as Software as a Service (SaaS). This means that each installation of Deebase will be tailored around customer's needs; No updates and management costs, as service providers we will take care of all the technical aspects from installation to customization and maintenance, so that customers and their community managers could focus on contents. Distributing Deebase as SaaS also means that it could be used in many different contexts. For this reason the platform has been developed keeping in mind that it should be: easy to use, flexible and scalable. With easy to use we do not just mean graphically appealing and user-centered but also that interaction dynamics have to be simplified to the utmost. Keeping interaction modalities as-simple-as-possible would definitively contribute in lowering adoption barriers, maximizing the basin of attraction of the platform. Submitting an idea, commenting or casting a vote should as easy as sharing a post on Facebook or send a Tweet. In order to further reduce adoption obstacles, we’re also working on developing a mobile app of Deebase that will allow users to join the deliberative process and cast their votes simply tapping the screen of a smartphone or of a tablet. Moreover, Deebase has been designed in order to be flexible and scalable. Scalability is not just the capability of a platform to expand while maintaining the original performances and characteristics. Scalability can be interpreted also as the ability of a platform to be replicated in different environments, to adapt to peculiar contexts and needs while maintaining its basic structure. Deebase thanks to its distribution model and its cloud-based technical architecture can meet both requirements: adaptability to different contexts and scalability to high volumes. </p><h3> </h3><h3>External Links</h3><p><a href=""http://deeba.se"">Deebase - e-deliberation made easy</a></p><p><a href=""http://vimeo.com/70365872"">Deebase: a short introductory video</a></p><p><a href=""http://4d3.it"">Quattro di Tre Srl (4d3)</a></p><p><a href=""http://deebate.it"">Deebate.it</a> - The first ever Deebase powered community</p><h3>Notes</h3><p> </p>",en,1257,Deebase - e-deliberation made easy
"<h3>Definition</h3><p>Dynamic Facilitation, aka the ""choice-creating process"" is a specific form of working with groups that helps participants engage creatively with divergent perspectives.</p><p>Some of its hallmarks include: a) welcoming ""initial solutions"" as prototypes;  b) working with multiple divergent problem definitions for an extended period of time;  c) intensive use of active listening and ""we-flection"" with each participant; d) creating a safe space for both creative and critical thinking to occur simultaneously, by having participants direct critical comments to the facilitator, where they are reframed as 'concerns'; e) close mapping of each participant's contribution using four charts: solutions, concerns, data, and problem-statements. </p><h3>Problems and Purpose</h3><p>Within the realm of public participation, Dynamic Facilitation has been used with ""microcosm groups"" to explore challenging public policy issues. These applications are known as Wisdom Councils and Creative Insight Concils. Their purpose is to help community members gain a deeper appreciation of the complexity of the issue at hand, to engage in creative thinking about the issue, and to experience the greater sense of agency, meaning, and possibility that arise from authentic discourse. The outcomes of these ""microcosm councils"" are presented in a larger public meeting, to which community members, public officials, and government administrators are all invited.</p><h3>History</h3><p>Jim Rough originally developed Dynamic Facilitation to address challenging workplace issues with shop floor employees in paper mills and lumber mills in the Pacific Northwest. He then developed the Wisdom (microcosm) Council as a large-group application of this method, and used it successfully within several large organizations. Its first use in a public participation context was the Rogue Valley Wisdom Council, where a number of community members were chosen by lot and invited to participate in a facilitated day and a half, with the very open-ended topic of the general well-being of their larger community. At the conclusion of their extended conversation, the Wisdom Council presented their findings to a larger public gathering to which the whole community was invited. </p><p>This initial experiment resulted in a great deal of enthusiasm among both the participants of the Council as well as those who attended the public meeting afterwards. One of the attendees to the larger public gathering was Joseph McCormick, who was inspired by it to engage in further transpartisan work.  </p><p>Since that time, the format of ""Dynamic Facilitation + public microcosm"" has been used most extensively in the state of Vorarlberg in Austria, where the Office of Future-Related Issues has found this to be a highly effective approach for for public participation projects. They have conducted 20+ such projects in the six years between 2006 and 2013.</p><p>Outside of public participation projects, Dynamic Facilitation is also being used within organizational contexts in German-speaking countries, and the telecommunications company Swisscom has held a number of Wisdom Councils internally as an effective way to support the evolution of their organizational culture.</p><h3>Participant Selection</h3><p>There are three primary public-policy applications of Dynamic Facilitation: a) Community Wisdom Councils, where randomly-chosen participants engage in an open-ended exploration of what would be of benefit to the larger whole; b) Creative Insight Councils, where randomly-chosen participants explore a specific policy issue; and c) Dynamically-Facilitated stakeholder councils. Of these three approaches, only the first two use randomly-chosen participants.</p><h3>Deliberation, Decisions, and Public Interaction</h3><p>The participants in a dynamically-facilitated Choice-Creating Process engage in a creative exploration of an issue. Divergent and challenging perspectives are welcome, yet are redirected toward the facilitator, resulting in a climate where people feel safe to consider new perspectives. Some have called this a ""creative deliberation"", as the conversation generates a full and in-depth exploration of the issue at hand, yet in a non-linear manner.</p><p>The process evokes shared understandings and breakthroughs, rather than decisions among a fixed set of possibilities. A ""meeting of the minds"" (and hearts) is a typical outcome, although of course one cannot predict the particular area on which the group will arrive at their spontaneous convergence. </p><p>In the public policy applications, the microcosm group will explore the issue in a sequestered process, much like a jury (although with expert facilitation.) At the conclusion of their work, they share their findings at a large public gathering. Usually the gathering is run as a World Cafe, so that participants at the larger gathering will have the opportunity to respond in depth to the findings of the microcosm group. </p><h3>Influence, Outcomes, and Effects</h3><p>By design, Community Wisdom Councils and Creative Insight Councils are meant to influence the political process through their recommendations. Their findings do not have any formal authority. Nonetheless, they have some degree of moral authority based on their reflecting the thoughtful input of a random sample of the public at large, rather than the particular advocacy of an interest group.</p><p>In Austria, Switzerland, and Germany, where these processes have been used most extensively to date, the organizers generally obtain the agreement of the political and administrative sponsors, to respond explicitly to the recommendations in some way. Given the impossibility of foreseeing the outcomes of the process, the sponsors cannot guarantee that they will implement the reccomendations. However, they can commit to either implementing the suggestions or else offering a documented response as to why they decided to not do so. </p><p>At the public meeting, a volunteer task-force comprised is formed, comprised of members from various sectors, to meets monthly to monitor this implementation-and-response process. </p><p>To date, the effects have been largely favorable. Public officials and administrators have been positively impressed by the high quality of the input they receive, as well as by the microcosm participants' appreciation of the complexity of the issues involved, and their civic-minded enthusiasm. In turn, participants have repeatedly expressed a high degree of satisfaction with the experience, and often recommend that it be made more widely available.</p><p>In the State of Vorarlberg, where this approach has been used most widely, there has recently been a Constitutional Amendment on public participation. The implementation guidelines for this amendment provide for Wisdom Councils to take place on a yearly basis. In addition, for any public issue that gathers 1,500 signatures, the State will host a Creative Insight Council on that topic.</p><h3>Analysis and Criticism</h3><p>Vorarlberg's Office for Future-Related Issues (Büro für Zukunftsfragen) commisioned a qualitative research study to evaluate the outcomes of the ""BürgerInnenRäte"". The evaluation was conducted by the European Institute of Public Participation. </p><h3>Secondary Sources</h3><p>Dynamic Facilitation is mentioned in the following sources:</p><p>Atlee, Tom. The Tao of democracy: using co-intelligence to create a world that works for all.

"<p class=""MsoNormal"">Neighbourhood councils have been a part of Québec city’s democratic life for 20 years. The first experiences were implemented by the Ville de Québec in 1993, in order to get the citizens more closely involved in municipal politics. The concept was extended to the whole city territory in 1997. Today, Québec city hosts no less than 28 neighborhood councils, each of them being an independent legal corporation mandated to give advice to the city council and to initiate different projects in its area.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Genesis</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">The neighbourhood council project started to emerge in the mid-70s, with the formation of a new progressive political party on the Québec’s municipal scene: the Rassemblement populaire de Québec (Quebec Popular Rally, RPQ). </p><p class=""MsoNormal"">The creation of the RPQ was a reaction to the unpopular decisions of the Parti civique de Québec (Québec Civic Party) and to the important urban redevelopment that was taking place during the 60s and the 70s. During this time, entire neighbourhoods were destroyed or converted so as to allow for the construction of buildings, highways, commercial centres, etc. Some major projects like the construction of the Parliament hill and the Dufferin-Montmorency highway provoked the demolition of hundreds of properties.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">In the early 70s, a group of scholars of the Université Laval published an impressive study revealing the effects of the urban redevelopment and illustrated the indulgence of municipal elected officials towards the real estate developers. The study became an ideological reference for many groups of citizens, and the idea of a new political party flourished. A manifesto appealing to the mobilisation of the working class was issued in 1976, and the RPQ was officially created in 1977.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">The new party proposed a radical democratisation of the municipal structures with the establishment of neighbourhood councils. These democratic tools were supposed to enable citizens to resist to the power of capital and to protect their neighbourhoods. Twelve years and four municipal elections later, the RPQ came to power in 1989. The first neighbourhood councils took shape in 1993.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Composition</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">The neighbourhood councils have the status of non-profit organizations. They are autonomous legal corporations constituted by the Ville de Québec. This particular characteristic allows the councils to bypass the city mandate and to initiate actions on their own. Every citizen of a neighbourhood is member ex officio of its council.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">To form a council, 300 citizens of a neighbourhood (Québec city is composed of 8 boroughs and 35 neighbourhoods) have to sign a request. The city council then authorizes the holding of a special meeting during which the neighbourhood population is invited to vote secretly for or against the creation of a new council. If a majority of citizens support the project, a new meeting is called to elect a board of directors.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">The board of directors is composed of 11 voting members, which are distributed as follows:</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">·     Four women and four men elected by the neighbourhood population for two-year terms </p><p class=""MsoNormal"">·     Three people appointed by the elected directors for one-year terms</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">The elected directors serve on an individual basis and do not represent any particular group. In addition to these 11 members, the city councillors whose districts are within the neighbourhood limits can attend the council meetings without voting. The board of directors normally holds a meeting once a month.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Consultation</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">The neighbourhood councils (NCs) are invited to submit opinions to the executive committee on many areas of municipal responsibility. The city must submit any draft plans to amend or adopt a planning-related bylaw to the NCs. This includes decisions about planning, zoning, traffic, etc. Currently, the consultation is used in many other fields, such as security, housing, environment and even budget priorities. The consultation is usually done before the decisions are taken, so the citizens’ voice can have a real influence. According to the observations of scholars, neighbourhood councils’ advice is taken into consideration 80% of the time. </p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Consultation can take place in two ways. The city may consult only the board of directors of a neighbourhood council with a request for opinion, which generally concerns issues of minor importance. Or, when the topic is of greater importance, the entire neighbourhood population is consulted. A notice calling for a public consultation is published in the local newspapers and on the city website. Information about the consultation and the proposed solutions are distributed by mail to every resident. At the assembly, the city then presents a solution A and a solution B to the citizens. Finally, in the light of the citizens’ interventions and opinions, the board members formulate recommendations to the city (which may be a solution C). These recommendations are strictly advisory.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Initiative</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">As autonomous legal corporations, the NCs are also free to initiate consultations on their own and to formulate unsolicited advice to the executive committee. They can also organize activities to stimulate the life of their neighbourhood: festivals, concerts, etc.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">NCs also participate in the development of a neighbourhood master plan, which serves as an orientation and planning document with direct and short-term impacts within the neighbourhood. Once this master plan has been elaborated, neighbourhoods can receive special budgets from the city to realize projects that it established as priorities (Parks, public squares, etc.).</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Clash of visions</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">In the early 90s, the idea of neighbourhood councils was not well received by everybody. Two visions were firmly opposed to each other. For some people, the project was seen as a waste of time. Consultations would be expensive, long and fruitless. By promoting such a reform, RPQ was only proving its fear of duly exercising power.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">To persuade the sceptics of the legitimacy of this new approach, two NCs pilot projects were launched in 1993. This first experience lasted two years, during which citizens, elected officials and civil servants learned to deal with the concept, identifying the problems and proposing ameliorations. </p><p class=""MsoNormal"">This adaptation period was a key condition of success for the NCs in Quebec City. It led to the conciliation of the two opposed visions. On the one hand, the realisation of successful projects and the collaboration between the city council and the NCs proved the value of the new approach. On the other hand, citizens were almost unanimous in their belief that NCs should remain consultative and not decisional, so the elected officials would keep their traditional role.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Collaboration</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Over time, a fruitful collaboration developed between NCs’ members and city councillors. The councillor can help the citizens in the definition of their projects by providing information and sharing his or her experience. On the other side, many councillors believe that the NCs help them to better serve their constituents. NCs are their “eyes and ears” on the ground.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Democratisation</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Without a doubt, NCs gave citizens more influence in the development of their neighbourhoods. However, the experience showed some of its limitations 20 years after it was first implemented. Only a few citizens regularly attended the board of directors’ meetings. The participation is higher at the time of public consultation (between 50 and 400 persons), but the question remains: are NCs really acknowledged by the population as a democratic tool?</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">The elections held in 2012 showed how difficult it was for NCs’ advocates to get new citizens involved. Depending of the neighbourhoods, between 5 and 75 people attended the annual assemblies. Only one third of the NCs were able to elect a full 8-member board. A quarter of them barely made the quorum of five members, and at least two had to hold another election because they didn’t reach quorum.6</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Nevertheless, the structure appears to be here to stay. In 2011, Mayor Régis Labeaume faced opposition when he wanted to modify the NCs’ boundaries to harmonise them with the 27 districts boundaries. Many citizens resisted the project and made their case heard. The reform was finally abandoned.7</p><p class=""MsoNormal""> </p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Samuel Tremblay, Université de Montréal</p><p class=""MsoFootnoteText""> </p><p class=""MsoNormal"">This paper is part of a research project funded by the SSHRC, calls ‘Expertise, organizational field and the diffusion of public participation practices’ (2012-2016) and directed by Laurence Bherer (Université de Montréal), Mario Gauthier (Université du Québec en Outaouais) and Louis Simard (Université d’Ottawa).</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Sources :</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">[1] Bherer, Laurence (2011). « Les trois modèles municipaux de participation publique au Québec », Télescope, vol. 17, n° 1, p. 157-171.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">[2] Bherer, Laurence (2006). « Le cheminement du projet de conseils de quartier à Québec (1965-2006) : un outil pour contrer l’apolitisme municipal ? », Politiques et sociétés, vol. 25, no 1, 2006, p. 31-56.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">[3] Bherer, Laurence (2006). « La démocratie participative et la qualification citoyenne : à la frontière de la société civile et de l’Etat », Nouvelles Pratiques Sociales, vol.18, n°2 (Printemps), pp.24-38.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">[4] Bherer, Laurence et Sandra Breux (2012), « The Diversity of Public Participation Tools : Complementing or Competing With One Another », Canadian Journal of Political Science, 45:2 June 2012, 379-403.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">[5] Site de la Ville de Québec, Conseils de quartier.

"<p class=""MsoNormal"">The Right of Initiative to public consultations was adopted by the Montréal city council in September 2009 and has been in effect since January 1, 2010. This new democratic tool allows the Montrealers to initiate a public consultation on any matter that concerns the city or their borough. It is enshrined in the Montreal Charter of Rights and Responsibilities. </p><p class=""MsoNormal""> </p><p class=""MsoNormal"">As mentioned in the Charter, the Right of Initiative “empowers citizens to propose new and constructive solutions or innovative and mobilizing projects in order to meet the issues and challenges of their city by obtaining a public consultation following a petition.”1 However, the result of the process “has no decisional character”.1</p><p class=""MsoNormal""> </p><p class=""MsoNormal"">The Right of Initiative is one of the key projects developed by the Task Force on Democracy, a working group formed in 2002 in the midst of the municipal merger and the Montreal Summit. The Task Force is composed mainly of citizens who participate on a personal level, without the involvement of organizations. It is accountable to the mayor and aims to promote collaboration and cooperation between civil society and the city. The Right of Initiative was designed to this end.</p><p class=""MsoNormal""> </p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Two public consultations have emerged from the Right of Initiative since it was implemented in 2010; one about the “state of urban agriculture in Montreal” and another about “the sharing of the existing bike path network”. </p><p class=""MsoNormal""> </p><p class=""MsoNormal"">The petition</p><p class=""MsoNormal""> </p><p class=""MsoNormal"">The exercise of the right of initiative begins with the filing of a draft petition. This draft petition must clearly and briefly state the object of the proposed consultation, justify the desirability of the consultation and be signed by at least 25 people including three signatories designated to serve as representatives of the group.</p><p class=""MsoNormal""> </p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Within 15 days of the draft petition being judged admissible by the concerned authorities, a notice is given to announce the beginning of a petition signing period. To obtain a public consultation, groups must obtain a required number of signatures within the following 90 days. A total of 15,000 signatures are required for proposals that concern a central city matter. (As of 2011, Montréal had a population of 1.65 million people.) In the case of a borough, 5% of the population, up to a maximum of 5,000 signatures, has to sign the petition. (Population varies from borough to another. More than 160,000 people live in Cote-des-Neiges--Notre-Dame-de-Grace, but only a little more than 20,000 in Outremont.) To give young people “an opportunity to become involved with municipal affairs”2, the city of Montreal allows every person aged 15 years and over to participate to the process.</p><p class=""MsoNormal""> </p><p class=""MsoNormal"">The consultation</p><p class=""MsoNormal""> </p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Once the required number of signatures has been collected, a public consultation must be held within a reasonable delay. </p><p class=""MsoNormal""> </p><p class=""MsoNormal"">In the case of a public consultation bearing on a borough matter, the authority responsible for holding the consultation is the borough council, one of its committees, any committee or group of designated persons, as the council concerned may choose.</p><p class=""MsoNormal""> </p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Where the city is concerned, the consultation is held by one of the council committee or by the Office de consultation publique de Montréal (OCPM), an independent public organization whose mission is to carry out public consultation mandates entrusted to it by the Ville de Montréal city council or executive committee.</p><p class=""MsoNormal""> </p><p class=""MsoNormal"">The public consultation takes place in two parts. During the first part, representatives of the city or borough present information and answer questions from citizens. This is when those who have submitted the request will be required to explain the reasoning behind their request for a public consultation. In the second part, which takes place at least 15 days later, everyone gets the opportunity to express an opinion or submit a brief.</p><p class=""MsoNormal""> </p><p class=""MsoNormal"">The outcome</p><p class=""MsoNormal""> </p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Those in charge of the consultation have to publish a written report within 90 days following the end of the proceedings. The document will itemize all concerns and opinions expressed at the hearing, analyze the proposals and draw conclusions or formulate recommendations, but will not render a decision. Then, the borough council or city council will inform citizens of the findings of the public consultation and, depending on the case, announce decisions that may be made and the reasons behind them. </p><p class=""MsoNormal""> </p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Limitations</p><p class=""MsoNormal""> </p><p class=""MsoNormal"">The Montreal Charter of Rights and Responsibilities allows a maximum of three public consultations to be held per year by the city as part of the Right of Initiative, and two public consultations per year by each of the boroughs.</p><p class=""MsoNormal""> </p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Furthermore, certain matters are ineligible and will not be considered for public consultation if they concern, for example:</p><p class=""MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst"">•       the sharing of powers, or the governance or the status of the city</p><p class=""MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle"">•       administrative organization or contracts management</p><p class=""MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle"">•       budget, fees or taxes</p><p class=""MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle"">•       an urban development project for which a public consultation or approval by referendum has already been prescribed by law</p><p class=""MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle"">•       a project that has already been submitted for public consultation within the previous three years</p><p class=""MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle"">•       a call for tenders, pending or completed, or for which a contract has already been awarded</p><p class=""MsoListParagraphCxSpLast"">•       a matter pending before the court or a matter that was the object of a judgment, or an out-of-court settlement.</p><p class=""MsoNormal""> </p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Experiences</p><p class=""MsoNormal""> </p><p class=""MsoNormal"">The Right of Initiative was used successfully by the Montrealers in 2011, when 29,000 people signed a petition requesting a public consultation on the state of urban agriculture. (Urban agriculture can be defined as “the growing of plants and the raising of animals for food and other uses within and around cities and towns”7. Its proponents wanted to enlighten this growing phenomenon and to obtain public support, in order to make Montreal a more green and sustainable city.)</p><p class=""MsoNormal""> </p><p class=""MsoNormal"">The petition campaign was led by dozens of organizations and volunteers through the city for 90 days. The outcome was considered as a great success, as the proponents collected almost double the amount of required signatures. It forced then Montréal Mayor Gérald Tremblay to announce the holding of a public consultation under the auspices of the Office de consultation publique de Montréal in the spring of 2012.</p><p class=""MsoNormal""> </p><p class=""MsoNormal"">More than one hundred briefs and opinions were presented to the OCPM during the hearings, which were attended by some 1500 people. The process was longer and more comprehensive than what is prescribed by the law. Members of the commission attended meetings with representatives of several organizations in a “preconsultation” period. A scientific conference and a public exhibition on urban agriculture were organized. Six information sessions were then held across the city, before the citizens were invited to submit and present their briefs during seven audition sessions. People were able to participate on the commission website.</p><p class=""MsoNormal""> </p><p class=""MsoNormal"">That led to the release of a report detailing the state of urban agriculture in Montréal and identifying the main obstacles to its development in October 2012. The document also included a list of 20 recommendations to the city.</p><p class=""MsoNormal""> </p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Then, in March 2013, the Montréal executive committee announced the creation of a 20-member permanent working group on urban agriculture, to ensure the hearings would produce some concrete results.</p><p class=""MsoNormal""> </p><p class=""MsoNormal"">At the present time, only one other public consultation has emerged from the Right of Initiative. In September 2011, a group of citizens has submitted to the city a draft petition that was deemed eligible. The subject of the request was: ""Forbid electric scooters on Montreal bike paths"". Soon thereafter the city and the group representative agreed that a public consultation by a standing committee of city council on the types of vehicles that could be allowed or prohibited on the Montreal bike path network was sufficient. A series of 15 recommendations were eventually made to the city council in spring 2012.</p><p class=""MsoNormal""> </p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Samuel Tremblay, Université de Montréal</p><p class=""MsoFootnoteText""> </p><p class=""MsoNormal"">This paper is part of a research project funded by the SSHRC, calls ‘Expertise, organizational field and the diffusion of public participation practices’ (2012-2016) and directed by Laurence Bherer (Université de Montréal), Mario Gauthier (Université du Québec en Outaouais) and Louis Simard (Université d’Ottawa).</p><p class=""MsoNormal""> </p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Sources :</p><p class=""MsoNormal""> </p><p class=""MsoNormal"">[1] Ville de Montréal (2012), By-law 05-056-1: By-law concerning the Montréal Charter of Rights and Responsibilities and the Right of Initiative, Online. <a href=""http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/pls/portal/docs/PAGE/DROIT_INITIATIVE_FR/MEDIA/DOCUMENTS/BY-LAW_05-056-1_RIGHT_OF_INITIATIVE_IN_PUBLIC_CONSULTATIONS.PDF"">http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/pls/portal/docs/PAGE/DROIT_INITIATIVE_FR/MED...</a></p><p class=""MsoNormal""> </p><p class=""MsoNormal"">[2] Ville de Montréal (2011), Take the initiative...it’s your right!, Online. <a href=""http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/pls/portal/docs/PAGE/CHARTE_MTL_FR/MEDIA/DOCUMENTS/RIGHT_OF_INITIATIVE_BROCHURE_31-01-11_FINAL.PDF"">http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/pls/portal/docs/PAGE/CHARTE_MTL_FR/MEDIA/DOC...</a></p><p class=""MsoNormal""> </p><p class=""MsoNormal"">[3] Ville de Montréal (2011), Leaflet – Right of Initiative to public consultations, Online. <a href=""http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/pls/portal/docs/PAGE/DROIT_INITIATIVE_FR/MEDIA/DOCUMENTS/LEAFLET%20-%20RIGHT%20OF%20INITIATIVE%20TO%20PUBLIC%20CONSULTATIONS.PDF"">http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/pls/portal/docs/PAGE/DROIT_INITIATIVE_FR/MED...</a></p><p class=""MsoNormal""> </p><p class=""MsoNormal"">[4] Ville de Montréal – Cabinet du maire et du comité exécutif (2013), « Montréal met sur pied un Comité de travail de la collectivité sur l'agriculture urbaine », CNW Telbec</p><p class=""MsoNormal""> </p><p class=""MsoNormal"">[5] Ville de Montréal, Official city portal – Ville de Montréal, Online. <a href=""http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/portal/page?_pageid=5798,85041649&_dad=portal&_schema=PORTAL"">http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/portal/page?_pageid=5798,85041649&_dad=porta...</a> </p><p class=""MsoNormal""> </p><p class=""MsoNormal"">[6] Office de consultation publique de Montréal (2012), « L'agriculture urbaine à Montréal : des initiatives multiples qui nécessitent une meilleure coordination, estime l'OCPM », CNW Telbec</p><p class=""MsoNormal""> </p><p>[7] Office de consultation publique de Montréal (2012), État de l’agriculture urbaine à Montréal : Rapport de consultation publique, Online. <a href=""http://ocpm.qc.ca/sites/ocpm.qc.ca/files/rapport_au.pdf"">http://ocpm.qc.ca/sites/ocpm.qc.ca/files/rapport_au.pdf</a></p>",en,1588,The Right of Initiative to public consultations 
"<p><strong>Definition</strong></p><p>A charrette is a method of deliberation, through which participants from different subgroups of society reach a consensus position in a relatively short time. The charrette consists of three phases, the pre-charrette, charrette workshop and post-charrette stages. A charrette can be used with groups of varying sizes, from fifty to more than a thousand, and they can similarly be organized over a times span ranging from a couple of days to several weeks. A charrette can be used to bring together practical ideas, stimulate participants to work together, and facilitate consensus-based decision making. It is most suited for issues at the local level.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Participants </strong></p><p>Besides the organizers of the project, a charrette requires two groups of participants: a smaller steering committee of around 9- 15 members and a much larger charrette team. The steering committee is involved in all three phases, while the charrette team participates in the second (workshop) stage.</p><p>The steering committee should consist of people with diverging backgrounds and opinions/ideologies regarding the issue at hand. Meanwhile they should already be actively interested in the subject, and preferably have some type of expert knowledge. The steering committee coordinates the charrette activities (drafting a schedule, searching for financial support, supporting the workshop).</p><p>The charrette team is drawn from the affected community, and is supposed to be representative of the wider population. Although some are near universal (age, gender), the characteristics on the basis of which representativeness is determined can differ depending on the issue at hand.  </p><p> </p><p><strong>Process</strong></p><p>A charrette consists of three phases. In the pre-charrette stage, the steering committee prepares the logistics for the following two phases, defines the focus of the project, and drafts a preliminary list of subjects which will be discussed. During the charrette workshop itself, participants discuss with each other and with other stakeholders and create priority lists and recommendations and set out a strategy to implement specific projects. The post-charrette phase creates a final document based on these outcomes, containing an overview of action points…</p><p>Several things need to be realized by the steering committee in the pre-charrette stage: the subject or problem needs to be defined and limited, to avoid excessive open-endedness; participants for the charrette team need to be selected; stakeholders identified; information gathered on the current situation; and last but not least logistics need to be taken care of.</p><p>The workshop stage consists of several parts, although the organizers can of course set it up in many different ways. In this stage the largest group of participants is central. After everyone has been given the information gathered by the steering committee in the previous phase, they are divided into smaller subgroups. These have the opportunity to interview experts and stakeholders. Afterwards, they determine the most important elements of the issue at hand. They discuss their findings centrally, and then try to expand further on this again in separate, smaller groups. This can repeat itself many times, depending on the need. This process should be guided to ensure that the deliberations become increasingly more focused every time, until the participants are ready to start working on proposals and solutions. At that point, the group should be subdivided into working groups which each deal with a single element/ sub-problem of the larger issue. Every group should have at least one expert specialized in the specific area with which they deal. Again, formulating and elaborating plans/ proposals/ solutions in smaller groups and deliberating about them in the larger plenary can repeat after each other as often as needed.</p><p>In the post-charrette phase, then, the results of the charrette workshop are processed. This should take the form of a final document, which is ideally written in an accessible way, and summarized in a media-friendly format for the local news. One more meeting can then be organized some time later, which is supposed to be open for all. In it, the outcome of the charrette is presented in a forward-looking manner – focusing on implementation – and everyone has the opportunity to comment on the results and procedure.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Requirements</strong></p><p>Preparing a charrette takes a lot of time, and given the reliance of the method on going back and forth between plenary and focused discussions, a lot of time also needs to be reserved for the workshop itself (at least a few days). Material costs lie mostly in finding a good and large enough location, supplying the participants with anything they need (and probably a small reimbursement for their costs and time). The disadvantage of this method is the large amount of time it requires, which can make it difficult to find enough participants and means that it will probably be necessary to reimburse them for their time.</p><p> </p><p><strong>External Links</strong></p><ul><li>The Charrette Institute, with plenty of resources: <a href=""http://www.charretteinstitute.org/"">http://www.charretteinstitute.org/</a></li><li>What is a Charrette? <a href=""http://www.tndtownpaper.com/what_is_charrette.htm"">http://www.tndtownpaper.com/what_is_charrette.htm</a>  nm</li><li>‘User manual’, from the Kind Bauduin Foundation: <a href=""http://www.kbs-frb.be/uploadedFiles/KBS-FRB/Files/NL/PUB_1599_Methode_2_Charette.pdf"">http://www.kbs-frb.be/uploadedFiles/KBS-FRB/Files/NL/PUB_1599_Methode_2_Charette.pdf</a> [Dutch]</li></ul>",en,2840,Charrette
"<h3>Definition</h3><p>In 2005, Stephen Coleman called 'Direct Representation', ""an ongoing conversation... something that speaks to (citizens) emotional needs to be respected and treated as equals... in which representatives listen to and acknowledge the authority of the people they represent, and account openly for their own beliefs and actions."" His general form of direct representation has five features: public consultation (effective), two-way conversation (skilfully facilitated), ongoing attention (between elections), honesty (acknowledgement where wrong), and accountability (representatives explaining themselves).</p><p>The minimal form elaborated here offers representatives a minimum set of actions which could be taken by, or on behalf of (not least unwillingly), an elected representative.</p><p>The parenthetic suffix (Coleman) should enable differentiation from any other meaning of the term 'Direct Representation', not least <a href=""http://www.directrep.org/"">Dave Robinson's proposed voting system</a>.</p><h3>Problems and Purpose</h3><p>Coleman notes that the, ""dominant approaches to representation: first... pits direct democracy against representative democracy; and, second... sees representation as mimetic representativeness... a system that scores high on qualities of formal representativeness might, nevertheless, fail to represent, precisely because citizens and politicians fail to connect."" He concludes, ""Citizens don’t want to go through the time-consuming process of examining and voting upon every area of policy and piece of new legislation. They do not expect every decision to go their way, nor that politicians will perform miracles. They do expect, however, ordinary levels of competence and efficiency, and to be engaged in the political conversation as equals. And they want to know that their contribution will be valued – that it will make a difference... the challenge for democratic politicians is to be seen as ordinary enough to be representative, while extraordinary enough to be representatives.""</p><p>This method seeks to offer elected representatives (or political activists where representatives will not do it for themselves) a way to supplement the existing system, by informally hybridising it with aspects of direct democracy, i.e. it can be done now without awaiting system changes.</p><h3>History</h3><p>After returning to live in the UK in 2009 from 14 years away, the author was exploring how to apply experience gained in Asia around participatory development, to British local politics. Unable to source advice on how to pragmatically bridge the representative-direct democracy divide, he developed and in early July 2013 began to implement, the method described below experimentally, whilst a local activist in the membership of a mainstream political party. Continuing to seek theoretical underpinnings or criticisms to such a venture, he stumbled onto Coleman's work in late July 2013. This offered useful background and reasoning, although it did not detail the exact process proposed here.</p><p>Useful additional links discovered since include Mark Warren's 2009 paper about democratic deficits. He notes, ""The second kind of deficit calls for what I shall call the ‘retrofitting’ existing institutions: designing new forms of democracy which supplement and complement the formal institutions of electoral democracy, primarily in those functional policy areas where electoral institutions now have weak capacities to generate democratic legitimacy."" The retrofit he recommends, he calls 'Supplementary Democracy' noting, ""We have more questions than answers,"" about appropriate processes, ""but we should get started.""</p><p>Martin Karlsson has also offered useful insights in a paper dated 2010. Termed 'Interactive Democracy' (itself rooted in Leif Lewin's theorising in 1970), he defines it as, ""the practice among political representatives to interact in a responsive fashion with their voters, potential voters, or constituents regarding issues related to the relationship of representation."" He does however restrain his model, ""to regard only communication, and not, for example, the sharing of decision competences with citizens"".</p><p>Edmund Burke in 1774 offered perhaps the earliest, clear apology for representative democracy in the face of direct democracy (what he terms, ""the coercive authority of... instructions""). His arguments have been much debated since, and this method is essentially incompatible with Burke's conclusions.</p><h3>Participant Selection</h3><ol><li>Participants are drawn from the population of residents in a particular political constituency.</li><li>An elected constituency representative (or activist in their lieu) will attempt to contact all constituents.</li><li>Mechanisms should exist both to periodically purge the list of those who move out, and to add new constituents who move in or have never yet responded.</li><li>The representative will offer membership of a non-partisan voting panel of constituency residents.</li></ol><h3>Deliberation, Decisions, and Public Interaction</h3><p>This minimalist method recognises that representatives (and political activists) may for a range of reasons feel unable yet to develop extensively participatory approaches to democracy within their constituency. But it allows representatives to take a significant step in that direction:</p><ol><li>A topic is selected with sufficient notice which is scheduled for a forthcoming, openly notified, publicly accessible, municipal vote involving the relevant representative.</li><li>The representative (or activist) digests the issue and constructs a relatively simple polling question on the subject, involving equivalent options to those they will have at the vote (generally yes/no/abstain).</li><li>The representative (or activist) circulates the question to all members of the panel (along with links to publicly available agenda-related documents for those with an internet connection), giving them an efficient but simple mechanism for voting on which way the representative should themself vote, and a reasonable deadline for responding.</li><li>If necessary, an activist will collate and forward a summary; the representative should consider the proportion of votes offered for each option (or not replying) before deciding how they will vote themself on the issue.</li><li>The representative votes, preferably transparently (sometimes municipal votes are nodded through in council if no request is made to put the issue to a vote).</li><li>The representative (or an activist) feeds back to all panellists, and preferably also all constituents, how the representative voted.</li><li>The representative should account (or be invited to do so by the activist) to all  panellists, and preferably also all constituents, about the way they voted.</li><li>Constituent responses need to be managed, including 'unsubscribe' requests, broken email links, and wrong phone numbers, in preparation for the next cycle.</li></ol><h3>Influence, Outcomes, and Effects</h3><ol><li>Where an activist rather than the elected representative uses this method, it should aid the conscientization of constituents and their representative to their representative's (and municipality's) consultative democratic deficit.</li><li>Making use of such a panel part of an election candidate's personal manifesto in a conscientized constituency may increase the likelihood of their election, both through increased turnout by otherwise disaffected voters, and by allegiance switching by more regular voters.</li><li>By involving more socially excluded (including unregistered) constituents in the panel, not least by offering alternative forms of contact than the internet, systemic inequities can be partly addressed.</li><li>Where an advisory sub-group of panellists can assist with selecting issues and drafting questions, partisanship can be reduced (and be seen to be) despite the political affiliation of the representative/ activist managing the panel.</li><li>A representative should have a less tentative and more objective appreciation of the polarity and strength of feeling amongst constituents on the issue up for a vote, and be better able to test the viability and reasonableness of their personal opinion; they are likely to make a more valid choice themselves.</li><li>Representatives may even become <em>de facto</em> proxies without the formal institution of direct democracy (a positive feature of this method for those keen to see more direct democracy but not wanting to await the end of structural resistance to it).</li><li>Representatives are likely to clarify their own ethical boundaries, more often distinguishing them from political ones, with the potential to reduce partisanship.</li><li>A representative will have a better opportunity to engage in a conversation with constituents.</li><li>A representative will have a better opportunity to demonstrate their accountability to constituents.</li><li>A representative may well converse authentically with constituents far more than previously, not least given the need to start, maximise and sustain the panel, to everyone's greater satisfaction.</li><li>A representative may well influence similar developments amongst colleagues, and influence municipal systems, both processes enabling an increase in authentic participation across the municipality.</li><li>A representative may well be stimulated to progress from the limited form of direct representation to Coleman's proposed more general form.</li><li>Inevitably, expectations will be raised through beginning this process. If such expectations are broken, prior voter cynicism is likely to be more deeply entrenched.</li></ol><h3>Lessons Learned</h3><ol><li>Observors, critics, and sometimes panellists will often interpret the polling as a sample survey, and offer a critique of the supposed survey methodology. But it can be too obvious to grasp that:</li></ol><ul><li>firstly this panel is the <strong>population </strong>of constituents willing to interact; it is <strong>not </strong>a <strong>sample</strong>,</li><li>and secondly, polling is a (non-binding) proxy <strong>vote</strong>, <strong>not </strong>a <strong>survey</strong>.</li></ul><p>Were it a sample survey, it could indeed be criticised. But it is not designed to merely inform a representative prior to a vote, or it would ask a nuanced range of questions, preferably also with a qualitative component. It is a very specific aggregated proxy vote who's outcome the representative can choose to adopt or not.</p><p> </p><ol start=""2""><li>For several months from September 2010, the author piloted a doorstep random sample-survey approach to gauging constituency views about the way their representative should vote. For a constituency of several thousand voters, a desired yes/no response ratio of at least 60/40, an acceptable margin of error of 10%, and a confidence level of 95%, the sample size calculation was around 90.</li></ol><ul><li>For a short-notice poll, this proved logistically very difficult to achieve, suggesting it would be ultimately unsustainable.</li><li>Debriefing the outcome with colleagues indicated an intuitive disbelief that a sample size of 90 could be representative, despite its statistical <em>bona fides</em> (likely also therefore to feed the politician-mistrusting view of the average constituent). There was already an ambivalence about random sampling - purposive sampling would have been considered indistinguishable from biased sampling, probably undermining constituency trust.</li><li>The offer of influence was only made to a small percentage of constituents: to have even a 50/50 chance of one specific constituent being contacted in a year would require an unmanageable number of surveys, and to leave a significant number of constituents with the impression that they were being much more regularly contacted would not only be overwhelming in terms of work load, but would require an improbable number of issues coming up for vote.</li><li>A seasoned political colleague observed that constituents might feel disappointed - even cheated - if a survey were to bypass them: she noted that people would at least want to know in the aftermath of a vote that they had chosen not to respond, or been unavailable, or they might react disproportionately negatively. They would not want to know that the 'average' constituent's view had been considered by their representative, but that their own view had been, even if it had not prevailed.</li><li>The surveys did not add the complicating third option of abstaining, but even if it had, it could not account for strength of feeling without adding a supplementary question - complicating the analysis.</li><li>Political canvassers are familiar with, and already have systems for, visiting and providing printed information to every household.</li></ul><p>Constructing and maintaining a constituency-wide panel should not add significantly to, or disrupt, the work of the more committed local politician, and will be more sustainable than random survey sampling. Voting instead of surveying, and approaching the whole poll population instead of a sample, mean that non-response rates approximate the degree of importance of the issue to the polity, not the poll's representativeness (like comparing voting rates in local and national elections for non-compulsory voting jurisdictions). Whole-population voting is likely to be intuitively a more authentically personal communication than sample surveying in the eyes of constituents; as such it could also increase appreciation of subsequent feedback about the impact of 'my' response (even if it was a deliberate non-response).</p><p> </p><ol start=""3""><li>Limited direct representation had not (until at least 2014) been practised from the position of an elected representative; only that of a mainstream opposition political activist in a local authority first-past-the-post voting system.</li></ol><ul><li>Lack of incumbency (let alone lack of experience) could reduce an activist's apparent relevance.</li><li>Setting up a panel could be seen as merely a short term and partisan political tactic; it certainly introduces an extra barrier for the incumbent representative(s) facing such an activist's activities in their constituency, to such a scheme's implicit acceptability.</li><li>Constituency conscientization may possibly be aided by the apparent resistance of incumbents (representing the <em>status quo</em>), but it may simultaneously politicise the concept of participation and entrench vested interests.</li><li>Getting a political representative to be involuntarily accountable for their actions may be considered hostile, and at the very least will need careful management.</li></ul><p>No experience-based advice can be offered to incumbent representatives about the viability of introducing such a mechanism to their polity, but it is likely to be much more painless than doing so as an activist against ambivalent incumbents.</p><p> </p><ol start=""4""><li>Accusations can (and probably will) easily arise about bias in recruitment of panellists, the selection of voting topics, question phrasing, and feedback.</li></ol><ul><li>Early attempts to add panel members suggested that the political roots of the recruiter should be explicit (emphasised whilst speaking) not merely implied (for example with a badge), but the non-partisan nature of the panel should also be clear (for example, by not canvassing for political support on the same visit).</li><li>A standing offer should be made and repeated to panellists to offer themselves (transparently) to assist with question selection and wording.</li><li>Questions should not appear to persistently hound one particular political party, although even extremely contentious issues coming to a vote can usefully be put to a panel.</li><li>Guiding people to relevant agenda items and supporting documents needs to be sufficient yet not overwhelming; specific yet not selective.</li><li>Where agendas and upcoming votes are only available at short notice, it can be hard to satisfy any stakeholder in the process, but representatives should not be prioritised (so long as they can receive the polling summary before the vote) since they already have personal voting power (and accountability), may well have access to advance knowledge of upcoming agenda items, and in a pre-vote debate should anyway be logically open to last moment persuasion (this is not the place to critique 'whipped' votes!)</li><li>Neither sharing management of the panel with opposing politicians, nor placing it into constituency trusteeship had been attempted up until 2014.</li><li>The proportion of non-responders should be given in feedback to avoid misinterpreting the balance of support (e.g. 81 'Yes' / 19 'No' has a significantly different import if supplemented by 400 'Non-response').</li></ul><p>Such a panel can appear to be a very disruptive political tool, not least where it is not merely tactical but actually empowering local communities. Resistance taking the form of spoiling or disparaging are real possibilities.</p><p> </p><ol start=""5""><li>Such a panel can only serve a limited purpose - it is not a comprehensive participatory democracy methodology.</li></ol><ul><li>Early panellist recruitment suggested that an offer of contact, ""10-12 times per year - maximum,"" balanced palatability with joining rates, but an offer to choose a preferred contact frequency in the face of possible unlimited involvement appeared to actually reduce the overall joining rate.</li><li>If any panellists are recruited well before the first question is eventually asked, they may not recall the original contact and the first question may then appear to be unsolicited and even intrusive. It is worthwhile contacting all panellists with a welcome to the panel and a reminder of its purpose and activities within two months, if they do not receive their first question by then.</li><li>Without the more comprehensive participatory approach (Coleman's general direct representation), using the panel for <em>ad hoc</em> polling disconnected from transparent municipal votes (and associated public documentation) may be seen as partisan.</li><li>Every enquiry stimulated by the polling should be responded to as an opportunity to build authentic constituent conversations.</li></ul><p>On any particular issue, there is no reason a representative cannot try to persuade panellists of their own views prior to a panellists poll, even where the representative is clear that they will choose to abide by the majority position. This is not a formal proxy voting system after all, and representatives are entitled to disregard the majority opinion of their constituents. The key is to make this an opportunity for honest and transparent constituency conversation and increased two-way influence.</p><h3>Secondary Sources</h3><p><a href=""http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/v1ch13s7.html"">Burke, E.

"<h3>Definition</h3><p>An electoral district forum is an online nonpartisan <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_forum"">discussion board</a> for the constituents of a single officeholder to interact with themselves, and with their incumbent and candidate political leaders. It is designed to make it easier for representatives to be more responsive to their constituents. It does this by increasing dialogue and by reducing everybody's dependence on expensive mainstream media.</p><h3>Problem and Purpose</h3><p><strong>Problem</strong>: In the U.S., representatives aren't responsive to all their constituents anymore, only the wealthy ones. This is because communications between politicians and constituents mainly go through expensive mainstream media.</p><p><strong>Purpose</strong>: To reform U.S. politics to be more inclusive and representative by adding inexpensive <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_democracy"">participatory democracy</a> elements.</p><p><strong>Approach</strong>: To move political discourse away from commercial media (both online and traditional), and towards non-commercial online public spaces where it can be more inclusive, accessible, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing_Consent"">unfiltered</a> and conversational.</p><p><strong>Method</strong>: To create nonpartisan discussion boards, one forum for each elective office, and then enlist political leaders and constituents to engage with each other there.</p><h3>Theory Background</h3><p><a href=""http://www.oecd.org/futures/35176328.pdf"">Stephen Coleman posited</a> that effective representative democracy requires that information flow in various channels and offered this appraisal of their status:</p><ul><li><strong>Government to Citizen</strong> (G2C) - takes place largely via the mass media</li><li><strong>Citizen to Government</strong> (C2G) - is limited</li><li><strong>Citizen to Citizen</strong> (C2C) - is the basis of a healthy civil society, but is in decline</li><li><strong>Citizen to Representative</strong> (C2R) - is very limited</li><li><strong>Representative to Citizen</strong> (R2C) - is limited outside of election campaigning</li></ul><p><a href=""http://www.ippr.org/assets/media/ecomm/files/Stephen_Coleman_Pamphlet.pdf"">Coleman subsequently surveyed </a>2,273 UK citizens to characterize what they ideally wanted in their relations with their representatives. He found a strong desire for a connectedness, and that they specifically wanted:</p><ul><li>To be heard</li><li>Conversations, not consultations</li><li>Ongoing, rather than episodic, contact</li><li>Honest yet not adversarial discussions</li><li>Representatives to account for themselves</li></ul><p>So in theory terms, the underlying problem the model seeks to address is that communication among citizens (C2C) and between representatives and citizens (C2R/R2C) is too little, too infrequent, and not significant enough.</p><h3>Basic Model</h3><p><strong>Electoral district forums</strong> are online <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_forum"">discussion boards</a> for the constituents of a single officeholder to interact with themselves, and with their incumbent and candidate political leaders. They are intended to provide inexpensive and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing_Consent"">unfiltered</a> channels of continuous C2C/C2R/R2C information flow which are apart from the mainstream media.</p><p>Online civic engagement forums have existed <a href=""http://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/838/747"">in listserv form since 1994</a>, and discussion boards have existed <a href=""http://talkingpointsmemo.com/theslice/confessions-of-an-online-forum-loyalist-in-facebook-reddit-era"">in modern form since 1999.</a> As a result, the community dynamics of online political forums are pretty well known, as are the problems which can arise. This previous experience tells us that certain design features (such as being moderated) need to be present if district forums are to be successful.</p><p>There are a lot of these features, and it requires a few paragraphs to adequately describe them and how they can be implemented in a discussion board. Therefore, the detailed model is presented in Appendix 1 below.</p><h3>Implementation</h3><p>I have put together a fully functional <a href=""http://www.electoraldistrict.org/pa/senate/index.php"">prototype</a> district forum, using the popular and secure open-source <a href=""http://www.phpbb.com/"">phpBB</a> software. The prototype is presented in Appendix 2 below, and its code is available upon request. Based on it, a small district forum could be hosted very inexpensively (a few dollars a day) and without any requirements for programming skills.</p><h3>History</h3><p>While many ideas for participatory politics projects similar to electoral district forums exist - see <a href=""http://participedia.net/en"">Participedia</a> and <a href=""http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/9/11/35176328.pdf"">Promises and Problems of E-Democracy</a> for examples - this specific model has never been tried out before. However, district forums can be considered an extension/optimization of a long-standing internet tradition: the <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/wiki/index"">Ask-Me-Anything (AMA)</a>.</p><p>Since their genesis back in 2005, AMAs have become a <a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/01/ama-how-a-weird-internet-thing-became-a-mainstream-delight/282860/"">mainstream interview format</a> and politicians have recently begun participating in them. Barack Obama did an AMA on Reddit <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z1c9z/i_am_barack_ob"">in 2012</a>, and 2016 presidential candidate Bernie Sanders has generated a <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2015/5/7/8560925/bernie-sanders-reddit"">lot of acclaim</a> for three which he did in 2013-15.</p><p>A comparison of district forum discussions and Reddit AMAs is given in Appendix 3; there are many points of similarity. Given this fact, if a district forum is started up then voters should quickly grasp how they work and what they are trying to accomplish.</p><h3>Participant Selection</h3><p>Each district forum is focused on a single elective office. Politician participation is therefore limited to the incumbent representative and to any challenging candidates for the office.</p><p>Citizen participation is more open in that anyone can register and get involved. However, many privileges will be limited to district residents. For example, only a constituent will have the ability to “like” a post, and only they will be eligible to propose and participate in conversations with their political leaders. These special privileges will enable constituent views to be separately known, and will afford them greater access to their representative.</p><p>Since forum users' real life identities will be known by the forum administrators, the work required to moderate trolling will be minimized.  However, the use of anonymous usernames will be encouraged to allow citizens to express their political views without fear of persecution.</p><h3>Deliberation, Decisions, and Public Interaction</h3><p>The internet has revolutionized many aspects of society, but so far its impact on constituent-representative communication has been comparatively minor. Significant <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-democracy"">e-democracy </a>advances have occurred <a href=""http://www.igi-global.com/article/content/76929"">mainly in terms</a> of information provision and delivery of public services. What have been conspicuously missing are advances incorporating dialogue, the core of democratic governance.</p><p>To help remedy this, fostering dialogue is a major goal of a district forum. The importance of unfiltered dialogue, and how district forums make use of it, is further discussed in Appendix 4 below.</p><p><strong>Constituent-Representative Dialogues:</strong> Forum interactions between citizens and political leaders follow a process in order to facilitate written or verbal dialogues. Because there are many thousands of constituents for every representative, discussion and voting are used to identify the questions and questioners the electorate is most interested in.</p><ul><li>Constituents start the process for a written discussion by submitting questions in a “Questions Asked” subforum.</li><li>Constituents discuss and rank the existing questions in the same forum.</li><li>When politicians decide to engage in a dialogue based on a top-ranked question, they create a new topic in a “Questions Answered” subforum. There they repeat the question and provide their answer.</li><li>The constituents who asked selected questions (and only they) are able to post follow ups.</li></ul><p>These written discussions continue until they are terminated by mutual consent, or the moderator concludes they have outlived their usefulness. Many conversations will amicably end after the constituent and representative have learned exactly where they disagree.</p><p>Because there is little time pressure in this discussion format, an unusual degree of scholarship can be exercised. For example, each side can:</p><ul><li>ask for proof that suspect assertions are supported by the facts,</li><li>include visual information like graphs, charts and photographs, and</li><li>ask that the other read and respond to an external document such as an article.</li></ul><p>The same two-step process is used to organize off-line verbal discussions to be held via video-conference, tele-conference, or at a meeting hall. Initiating a verbal discussion would begin with a post in the “Discussions Asked” subforum. Ultimately, video or audio of the completed discussion would be posted in the forum.</p><p><strong>Citizen-Citizen Interactions</strong>: These interactions are more free-form, and this part of the forum is more experimental. The “District Talk” and “Dispatches” subforums in the <a href=""http://www.electoraldistrict.org/pa/senate/index.php"">prototype</a>provide templates for what citizens could do: post and answer polls, read and write letters to the community, debate issues, etc.</p><p>The size of the district will impact what is practical and useful here. A <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_democracy#Democratic_reform_trilemma"">small enough</a> district could experiment with <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_democracy"">participatory democracy</a> initiatives, or work to build up an <a href=""http://www.ippr.org/assets/media/images/media/files/publication/2011/05/Realising%20Democracy%20Online%20-%20in%20_1230.pdf"">online civic commons</a>. The admins/moderators of a large district forum would have to work to prevent the same subforums from becoming an unusable cacophony.</p><h3>Influence, Outcomes, and Effects</h3><p>An electoral district forum's goal is to create new channels for C2C/C2R/R2C information flow. Put less abstractly, its goal is to facilitate some basic democratic actions:</p><ol><li>Citizens publicly discuss among themselves what the community preferences for policy are</li><li>Candidates inexpensively campaign to tell the community how they propose to implement its policy preferences</li><li>The policy preferences of the entire community, not just its wealthiest citizens, are made clear to everyone</li><li>The representative communicates her positions and tactics to the community</li></ol><p>The activity level of a forum can be easily quantified through pageviews, links to it, shares on social media, etc. The forum's impact on its community will be proportional to its activity level.</p><p>The presumption behind the project is that increased levels of C2C/C2R/R2C communication will naturally result in more representative governance. This would manifest itself by incumbent representatives changing their behavior, or by their being replaced by more populist candidates for their office.</p><h3>Criticism</h3><p>1.  One criticism of the district forum concept is that potential participants will be scared off by its novelty.  This can be addressed by beginning with a simple, online implementation of a candidate townhall - something everyone is familiar with.  After users are comfortable with the site, additional subforums and communication flows can be added.</p><p>2.  A second criticism is that the benefits of the forum - increased voter engagement - are too abstract and too long term to attract many users.  To overcome this, it would be very useful to add simple services to bring users in.  One idea is to offer users: </p><ul><li>scheduled notifications of elections in their district, via a method of their choice (text or e-mail) at a time of their preference</li><li>automatic notifications of any changes in their voting registration status</li><li>the ability to let campaigns know that they do not want to be canvassed or robo-called</li></ul>​Users would customize these services by filling out fields in their profile. <p>3. Successful U.S. politicians enjoy a very high degree of job security, along with the prospect of a lucrative lobbying career after retirement. A third criticism is that many incumbents will refuse to participate since it would conflict with their current career path of representing only their wealthy constituents.</p><p>Incumbent non-participation is not just a valid concern, it is pretty much guaranteed to happen. However, there are paths to get a district forum started even without the incumbent on board:</p><ul><li>Challenging candidates interested in a more populist career path may find participation attractive. Their participation should provide enough ‘buzz’ to attract constituents, which would in turn generate pressure for incumbent participation.</li><li>Occasionally there are open races without a defending incumbent.</li><li>Advocacy groups may find forum participation a useful way to get their message out to their fellow citizens, even if the incumbent isn't responding.</li></ul><p>Alternatively, other countries have campaign financing traditions which are less corrupting, and have less of a tradition of a revolving door between public service and lobbying. These countries may be more fertile soil for the concept than the U.S.</p><p>4. A fourth criticism is that participating in a district forum will hurt, not help, a candidate. The reasoning here is that the candidate's posts will provide material which will be spun and put out in a mainstream media attack ad by a non-participating candidate. Weighing against this scenario happening is that:</p><ul><li>attack ad fodder is already plentiful since <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/tracking-the-trackers-what-its-like-to-have-the-most-mind-numbing-job-in-a-campaign/2014/10/14/a2ed9d46-50a0-11e4-8c24-487e92bc997b_story.html"">trackers</a> often record what a candidate says at public (and even <a href=""http://newsinmi.com/republicans-caught-using-spyglasses-at-schauer-campaign-fundraiser/"">private</a>) events,</li><li>written posts are less useful than verbal gaffes for attack ads since posts can be edited for clarity after publishing, and vetted by staff before, and</li><li>dishonest quotation in an attack ad is liable to backfire since it is so easy for constituents to click over and read the full context of the misrepresented statement.</li></ul><p>5. A final criticism is that it is extremely difficult to build up a new online community, as is proposed here.  Because very few voters actively seek out information about political issues and candidates, not many will come across their district forums via Google searches.  And if they do find it,  a big barrier to participation is that people don't want to register with yet another website that requires a username and password for them to memorize.</p> Fortunately, district forum communities don't need to be created from scratch, because the discussion board software can be tightly integrated with the existing social networks.  And social networks are ubiquitous - over 85% of U.S. households have at least one active Facebook user, and Facebook is only one of many networks. District forums take advantage of existing social networks with: <ul><li><strong>Social media sharing buttons for every post.</strong> Since many of a person's social media friends are local and live in the same electoral district, sharing will frequently take place. For example, if a forum user likes an asked question and wants to see the representative answer it, sharing the post on Facebook provides an easy way for the user to get it upvoted.</li><li><strong>Easy registration with an existing social media account.</strong> So if a Facebook friend sees the shared post and wants to upvote a question, it takes only one click for them to register to do so.</li></ul><h3>Secondary Sources</h3><ul><li>Democracy, deliberation and design: the case of online discussion forums, by Scott Wright and John Street (2007, <a href=""http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Scott_Wright11"">pdf</a>)</li><li>Direct Representation: Towards a Conversational Democracy, by Stephen Coleman (2005, <a href=""http://www.ippr.org/assets/media/ecomm/files/Stephen_Coleman_Pamphlet.pdf"">pdf</a>)</li><li>Extending the Public Sphere through Cyberspace: The Case of Minnesota E-Democracy, by Lincoln Dahlberg (2001, <a href=""http://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/838/747"">html</a>)</li><li>Managing Online Forums: Everything You Need to Know to Create and Run Successful Community Discussion Boards, by Patrick O'Keefe (2008, <a href=""https://books.google.com/books?id=wD1A5rrD8w4C"">Preview</a>)</li><li>Promise and Problems of E-Democracy: Challenges of Online Citizen Engagement, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (2003, <a href=""http://www.oecd.org/futures/35176328.pdf"">pdf</a>)</li><li>Realising Democracy Online: A civic Commons in cyberspace, by Stephen Coleman and Jay G.

There are many ways such a concept could be implemented, but knowledge of related projects suggests the following features would help it succeed:</p><p><strong>Focused</strong></p><ol><li>restricted to a single electoral district - to narrow focus onto one geographical area and one political office</li><li>with clear goals - increasing information flow (C2C, R2C and C2R)</li></ol><p><strong>Fair</strong></p><ol start=""3""><li>nonpartisan - so everyone feels welcome</li><li>moderated - to keep things civil</li><li>non-anonymous - so people take their posts seriously, but only forum moderators are privy to posters' real names and e-mail addresses</li><li>with disclosure of interests - it must be made clear if someone is posting as part of their paid work</li><li>with limits on user posts - so the conversation isn't monopolized by a small number of people</li></ol><p><strong>Inclusive</strong></p><ol start=""8""><li>online - so it's easy to participate</li><li>mainly text based - to keep it simple, inexpensive, informative and searchable</li><li>optimized for searchbots - to make it easy to find content through Googling</li><li>registration via existing accounts - the vast popularity of Facebook, NextDoor, etc., will allow many (&gt;85%) to become registered forum users with one click</li><li>integrated with social media - to foster participation by making it very easy to share posts</li></ol><p><strong>Conversational</strong></p><ol start=""13""><li>with an emphasis on dialogue - to prevent uninformative “defense by talking point”</li><li>with dialogue subforums - these will have restricted posting permissions to prevent a cacophony</li><li>continuously run - a continuing conversation, not a one-off or an occasional interview</li><li>with internal communication systems - to make it easy to communicate privately to other users through message, chat or forwarded e-mail</li></ol><p><strong>Useful</strong></p><ol start=""17""><li>factual - with fact-checking encouraged since people are not entitled to their own reality</li><li>with “like” voting system - so posts can be ranked by popularity</li><li>with polls - to quantify what the community thinks</li><li>organized with categories and tags - to help find what the community has discussed in the past</li><li>with video discussions also possible - because footage can be much more dramatic and viral than text</li></ol><p><strong>People Powered</strong></p><ol start=""22""><li>volunteer run and hosted - so it is independent of outside funding</li><li>simple - so volunteers can moderate or admin without extensive training</li><li>inexpensive to host - to make it possible to be independent</li><li>nonprofit - to focus on community serving and not profit seeking</li></ol><p><strong>Politician Friendly</strong></p><ol start=""26""><li>fully open only to district residents - since non-constituent opinions are of limited interest to representatives</li><li>with a reasonable time commitment - staff can write first drafts of responses, only highly upvoted questions need to be responded to, etc</li><li>deliberative - staff can vet posts prior to publishing since there is little time pressure</li><li>correctable - posts can be updated afterwards for clarification or correction</li></ol><p>A standard, open-source <a href=""https://www.phpbb.com/"">phpBB</a> discussion forum will automatically have features 8, 9, 15, 16, 19, 21, 23, 24, 28 and 29. The remaining ones can be added in the following ways:</p><ul><li>additional software code: 10, 11, 12, 18 and 20</li><li>website rules and organization: 1, 5, 6, 7, 22, 25, 26 and 27</li><li>discussion forum structure: 2 and 14</li><li>forum moderation and norms: 3, 4, 13 and 17</li></ul><h3>Appendix 2: Prototype Software</h3><p>I have put together a fully functional prototype district forum based on the popular and secure open-source <a href=""http://www.phpbb.com/"">phpBB</a> software. This software is able to handle very large communities - the <a href=""http://forums.realgm.com/boards/index.php"">largest one </a>running it has over 100,000 registered users and over 28 million posts.</p><p>This screen shot of the prototype's <a href=""http://www.electoraldistrict.org/pa/senate/index.php"">homepage</a> shows one way in which the categories and subforums could be organized:</p><img alt="""" height=""450"" src=""http://images.dailykos.com/images/144545/large/pa-senate-electoraldistrict-forum.gif?1432245790"" width=""600"" /><p>The basic phpBB board has been extended through the use of approved mods and some custom coding. The prototype incorporates most of the desired features discussed in Appendix 1. For example, the prototype software includes both a “like” button for every registered user, and a “+like” button that is only available to district residents. Tallying likes allows the best questions, petitions, etc., to get ranked above the less interesting ones.</p><h3>Appendix 3: Electoral District Forums and Ask-Me-Anythings</h3><p>District forums can be considered an extension/optimization of a long-standing internet tradition: the <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/wiki/index"">Ask-Me-Anything</a> (AMA). The format of an AMA is that any registered user can submit questions and vote to rank others. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reddit"">Reddit</a> is currently the most popular website for this type of interview. The interviewee answers whichever questions he chooses for about an hour, ignoring upvoted questions <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2014/05/05/martin-omalley-did-a-reddit-ama-it-didnt-go-very-well/"">at his peril</a>. Questions and answers are both short, and there are no follow-ups.</p><p>There are many things to like about this <a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/01/ama-how-a-weird-internet-thing-became-a-mainstream-delight/282860/"">new social media form</a>. It is:</p><ul><li><strong>Online and free to use</strong> - so it's easy to participate</li><li><strong>Egalitarian</strong> - no users are privileged above others</li><li><strong>Unfiltered</strong> - no gatekeepers</li><li><strong>Responsive to good ideas</strong> - questions and suggestions are ranked by voting</li><li><strong>Moderated</strong> - which keeps things civil</li><li><strong>Nonpartisan</strong> - so everyone feels welcome</li><li><strong>Mainly text based</strong> - which keeps it simple, inexpensive, informative and searchable</li></ul><p>However, while the Reddit AMA format is a good fit for celebrities promoting something, or for Q&As with unusual people, it is a bad fit for constituents wanting to have substantive conversations with their representatives.  Here are some important issues:</p><ul><li>The politician AMAs that have taken place tend to be <a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/08/on-obamas-reddit-appearance/261758/"">dull and unenlightening</a> due to the lack of follow up questions.</li><li>Not many constituents will participate because of the event's brief time window.  For example, nobody living in the relevant district submitted questions to <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/SandersForPresident/comments/433vrw/lucy_flores_running_for_us_house_in_nv4_ama/"">this AMA</a> from a candidate for congressional office.</li><li>Because there is no identity verification, questioners may not be what they claim to be.  An account's comment history can't be used to definitively filter out sock-puppets because old Reddit accounts are openly sold to people wishing to influence discourse on the site.</li><li> Although in principle there is no gatekeeping on Reddit, in practice it happens all the time.  For example, organized users have done it through downvoting (""<a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/36xhxc/what_is_brigading_and_how_do_you_do_it/"">brigading</a>"") since the inception of the site.</li></ul><p>For citizen-representative conversations, I believe these important attributes need to be added to the Reddit format:</p><ul><li><strong>Emphasis on dialogue</strong> - to prevent uninformative Q&As where the answer is a talking point, and there are no follow-ups</li><li><strong>Continuously run</strong> - a continuing conversation, not a one-off or an occasional interview</li><li><strong>More inclusive</strong> - let people log in using their Facebook or other social media accounts</li><li><strong>Non-profit</strong> - to keep separate from Big Media, including Big Social Media</li><li><strong>Non-anonymous</strong> - to keep out <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/davidvinjamuri/2012/09/12/do-consumer-reviews-have-a-future-why-amazons-sock-puppet-scandal-is-bigger-than-it-appears/"">corporate</a> and <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/mar/17/us-spy-operation-social-networks"">government</a> sock-puppets</li><li><strong>Covers a single political office</strong> - to narrow the focus</li></ul><p>When these attributes are included, what results is close to being an electoral district forum as described in Appendix 1.</p><h3>Appendix 4: The Importance of Unfiltered Dialogue</h3><p>Minds work much better when they are open. Unfortunately, people have an innate <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_exposure_theory"">tendency</a> to seek out only information which reinforces their pre-existing views. Furthermore, in those important cases where opinion is <a href=""http://www.vox.com/2014/4/6/5556462/brain-dead-how-politics-makes-us-stupid"">bound up with identity</a>, a straightforward presentation of facts will often be rejected without being considered first. And to make matters worse the most accessible information, that provided by the mainstream media, is <a href=""http://www.electoraldistrict.org/white-paper/chomsky-challenge.html"">heavily filtered</a>.</p><p>A district forum aims to fight these effects by encouraging participation (active discussion or passive reading) in a nonpartisan forum filled with information and views which have not been pre-filtered by either the user or by the mainstream media.</p><p>Can dialoguing on forums result in people learning new things and viewpoints, and perhaps changing their opinions as a result? Certainly, but the process of opening a closed mind is slow, and one estimate is that it takes <a href=""http://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/838/747"" title="" The case of Minnesota E-Democracy"">three or four months</a> of forum participation for users to become receptive to new viewpoints.</p><p>Relatedly, wealthy interests have long used a <a href=""http://billmoyers.com/2014/01/10/why-conservatives-old-divide-and-conquer-strategy-%E2%80%94-setting-working-class-against-the-poor-%E2%80%94-is-backfiring/"">divide-and-conquer strategy</a> of fanning prejudicial resentment to gain the support of people who are hurt by their policies. However, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact_hypothesis"">personal contact</a> has been shown to be an effective way of reducing prejudice towards out-groups, even when the contact is <a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563214004324"">computer-mediated</a>. A recent study <a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022103112000108"">has demonstrated</a> that reductions in intergroup bias and anxiety occur after only two weeks of online interaction. District forums are one way of harnessing the power of personal contact.</p>",en,4241,Electoral District Forum

"<p><strong>Sociocracy</strong> is a whole system design for organizational governance and structure. It is applicable to and useful for any group of people who want to accomplish something together. The ""socios"" in sociocracy are the ""colleagues"" or ""companions"" - people with a social relationship and some identified common aims.</p><p><strong>Values</strong> of sociocracy</p><ul><li><strong>Equivalence</strong> – individuals function as peers in deciding how to accomplish their collective aims.</li><li><strong>Effectiveness</strong> – focus on policies and actions that accomplish collective aims; continual self-­improvement; designing for action.</li><li><strong>Transparency</strong> – direct access to all policy documents and records relating to one's work. No secrets! This supports equivalence, effectiveness and responsibilities of co-­leadership.</li></ul><p><strong>Principles</strong> of sociocracy</p><ul><li><strong>Consent</strong> - policy decisions are made by consent. Consent exists when there are no remaining objections to a proposed policy decision. Objections must be relevant to the collective aims. Objections must be explained so that all affected understand them, even if some disagree with the objection. An objection is not a veto or a block; it is a valid reason why a particular decision will prevent a member of the group from doing their job or supporting group aims. Objections are solicited because they provide valuable information. The reasoning behind them allows the group to improve the proposal so all members of the group can work toward their aims more effectively.</li><li><strong>Circles</strong> - a circle is a semi-­autonomous and self-­organizing unit that has its own domain and aim. It makes policy decisions within its domain; delegates leading, doing and measuring functions to its own members; maintains its own memory system; and plans its own development (learning, adapting, improving). Circles correspond to working groups in various types of organizations: departments, divisions, teams, committees, associations, etc.. Each circle has its own aim(s) and steers its own work by performing functions of leading, doing, and measuring for itself. Together the lead­do­measure functions establish a feedback loop, making the circle self­-regulating and self­-correcting. The domains and aims of different circles within an organization range from broad and general to specific and focused.</li><li><strong>Double-­linking</strong> (feedback) - a double link between one circle and another is formed by two people who are full members of both circles. For a given circle, one link is a circle member elected to be a link to the next more general circle. The other link is the operational leader of the circle, who is elected by the next more general circle. There can be more than two links. Double­-linking ensures that information moves in both directions between circles and increases integrity of information transfer. Through double links, feedback travels up, down and across the circles within an organization.</li></ul><h3>Problems and Purpose</h3><p>Coming soon...</p><h3>History</h3><p>The name <em><strong>sociocracy</strong></em> was coined by August Comte, an early nineteenth century French philosopher and founder of the science of sociology. Sociocracy literally means rule by the “socios,” people who have a social relationship with each other. In contrast, democracy means rule by the “demos,” the general mass of people who have little in common. Comte proposed a system of thought and organization known as positivism that he hoped would provide the basis for a stable society and personal fulfillment in the context of the then emerging industrial revolution. However, Comte was not able to suggest a practical structure for his ideas about sociocracy.<br /><br />Later in the 1800’s John Stuart Mill advocated worker cooperatives in which the workers controlled all equity and selected their own management, the beginning of the co-op movement that has had some limited success. In the 1920’s, pioneering management scientist Mary Parker Follett noted that in the most productive companies workers strongly identified with the organization as “their” company, allowing them to focus without conflicting feelings on the work of the company and how to make it run effectively. She discerned, however, that no structure existed which allowed such identification to be founded on anything other than a difficult to maintain illusion. It remained for work later in the 20th century by systems scientists, most notably Wiener, Nash, (featured in the movie A Beautiful Mind), and Prigogine (who won a Nobel prize for his work on self-organization), to lay the intellectual foundation for such a structure, the structure offered by sociocracy.<br /><br />Prior to the development of sociocracy’s practical structure, cultivating an environment that consistently maximizes the potential of an investor-manager-worker partnership has, in general, remained in the hands of a few gifted managers. Sociocracy takes that sort of partnership out of the realm of such ""genius heroes"" and into the hands of ordinary people.<br /><br />Gerard Endenburg developed the foundations for the logical structures and processes of contemporary sociocracy, using his family's business in The Netherlands as his laboratory. He was inspired by experiments by Kees Boeke, a Dutch educational reformer and management scientist, whose school he attended as a boy, as well as by his training as an engineer at a time when systems theory and cybernetics were new and exciting fields of theory and practice.</p><p>In practical operation for more than thirty-five years, sociocracy has progressed past the experimental stage and is successfully serving a  variety of organizations worldwide, as diverse as an electrical contracting company, a specialty plastics manufacturing company, a municipal police department, a Buddhist monastery, a nursing home, a chain of hairdressing shops, a local public school system, an international membership organization, a school of media and design, and numerous others.</p><h3>Participant Selection</h3><p>Coming soon...</p><h3>Deliberation, Decisions, and Public Interaction</h3><p>Coming soon...</p><h3>Influence, Outcomes, and Effects</h3><p>Coming soon...</p><h3>Analysis and Lessons Learned</h3><p>Coming soon...</p><h3>Secondary Sources</h3><p>Coming soon...</p><h3>External Links</h3><p>Sociocracy.info - <a href=""http://sociocracy.info"">http://sociocracy.info</a></p><h3>Notes</h3><p> </p>",en,4149,Sociocracy

"<h3>Problems and Purpose</h3><p>Every fall, the Enschede municipality in the Netherland establishes a budget for the coming years. A preliminary version is proposed by the executive board, which is then modified by motions and amendments from the municipal council. Generally these modifications are thought up by political parties. The purpose of the motion market is to allow citizens and civil society groups to present their own ideas and convince elected politicians to adopt these, to facilitate ideas from wider society to reach the level of policy. Citizens and civil society organizations presented ideas on the ‘market’, with every group having their own stall. Members of the city council walked around in a shopping manner, looking at the ideas and talking to their supporters. Every time a match was established between a council member and the initiator(s) of an idea, they would sign a form committing them to jointly draft the text for a motion or amendment. The forms signed at the market when an idea is adopted look very similar to a legal contract, and are supposed to ensure that both council members and citizens commit to further steps.  </p><h3>History</h3><p> </p><h3>Participant Selection</h3><p> </p><h3>Deliberation, Decisions, and Public Interaction</h3><p> </p><h3>Influence, Outcomes, and Effects</h3><p> </p><h3>Analysis and Lessons Learned</h3><p> </p><h3>Secondary Sources</h3><p> </p><h3>External Links</h3><p> </p><h3>Notes</h3><p> </p>",en,4317,"Motiemarkt ""Motion-Market"""

Humanity needs to identify the form of the needs, including the decision-making process, and try to satisfy them for its own good.</p><p>Max-Neef classifies the fundamental human needs as freedom, participation, creation, leisure, understanding, identity, protection, subsistence, affection.</p><p>Freedom is most influential for our design. We try to minimize chances for any kind of oppression and be still friendly, economic and transparent.</p><p>Participation is easier, because other needs may be partly satisfied at the event. More opinions could be presented in a private discussion, including taboo and storytelling. We accept cooperation as well as we support the formation of other groups.</p><p>Creation we satisfy by never ending brainstorming. We also show organizers of workshops and seminars their possible audience.</p><p>Leisure we support by comfortable settings, games and number of activities that can be organized in or by the assembly.</p><p>Understanding is better in privacy with less pressure for rhetorics and oversimplification. Assembly is suitable for organizing courses. Courses for more than five people should not happen in the assembly.</p><p>Identity may be provided by working for assembly. Other organizers may develop new identities too. Work for assemblies is also one source of authors identity.</p><p>Protection is provided as assembly and its projects support creation of social ties, that are helpful in case of misfortune.</p><p>Subsistence is not the main focus of the assembly, still it may be helpful for sharing and selling used stuff. Some projects like community gardening still may provide significant subsistence.</p><p>Affection is also a little bit supported. Roles of interviewers and innovators in the assembly may be very helpful for people who seek more affection.</p><p>Issues solved by political science as non-participation, media influence, scalability, language barriers, spam, digital divide, aggression, and authoritarianism are taken into consideration and when posing a significant problem, there should be an attempt to keep satisfying the needs and diminish the problem. Not to get overly concerned about the problem and forget about human needs.</p><h3 class=""western"">History</h3><p><u><a href=""http://participedia.net/en/cases/spole-ensk-burza"">First t</a>est</u></p><p>Second test in Hradec Králové had no visitors.</p><p>There will be trird test and later development.</p><h4 class=""western"">Participant Selection</h4><p>Everybody is allowed to come. People from a local neighborhood are expected. The assembly may ostracize, but ostracized may visit another assembly.</p><h3 class=""western"">Deliberation, Decisions, and Public Interaction</h3><p>First assembly is simplified. Ideas are registered and published to create spontaneous brainstorming. At the same time, common sense is used to place ideas to opinion polls. Opinion polls collect approvals to proposals and ideas within a limited time and return back. Important results are published. For publishing website, flip-chart or blackboard may be used.</p><p>Later assemblies should become spontaneously more complex. Next paragraphs should outline it.</p><p>Ideas should be collected in many ways, for example direct entry to website(e.g. facebook group), most of face-to-face interactions with visitors should ask for more ideas, inboxes,…</p><p>Proposals should be created at the moment when an idea has significant support, because proposals with low support may be discarded from later opinion polls. Every proposal has individual decision rule. Low decision rule may be a cause for low support and legitimacy, because anybody should refuse to support a proposal with low decision rule. (She may also create new proposal with higher decision rule.) To give an advice for creating decision rule, proposals with higher sunk cost should have higher supermajority. Minimum rule is majority rule 50%. One more reason for higher decision rule is a system of decisions, where the higher decision rule, the more legal power. It is necessary to get more legal power to improve or overwrite a previous decision. Also, the decision are aging, e.g. automatically loose 2% of legal power (which is derived from decision rule) per year, because of human maturation, death, and opinion shifts. This should be strong foundation for the search for common ground in decision-making.</p><p>(note to incorporate: The questionaire should allow for more predefined answers e.g. A - yes, it is perfect B - yes D - yes, I will use it E - yes, if you like it  F - yes, if somebody will pay it G - good idea, but make it more detailed L - I do no know this M - I cannot decide N - no response  R - no, too much legal power S - no, decision rule is too low T - no, democratically U - no, I will campaign V - no, I will dissent W - no, I will emigrate X - no, I will fight Y - this system is not suitable for this one Z - I do want fundamental system reform</p><p>If opinion poll is not enough, anybody may request vote. If public vote is not enough, anybody may request secret ballot. If vote is requested, request is published. Moderator announces vote at the moment when is the support in opinion polls for the proposal is peaking above or near decision rule. Participants should be able to see the results on-line in a few minutes. Moderator speaks quite rarely and may be replaced. If secret ballot is requested, some basic form may be organized. Everybody gets a piece a paper and pencil. One after another throwing their papers with yes or else into a ballot box.</p><p>Citizens are encouraged to talk in pairs and small groups. For those who are willing to play, social games may be used to establish new pairs or exchange partners. Pairs may talk about the proposals on information boards or their own ideas. Individual citizens may search public website with accepted proposals from other assemblies and may translate and register them as local proposals. It is recommended to mark translated proposals and get some support before registration or the proposal may be discarded after a few opinion polls.</p><p><br /> </p><h4 class=""western"">I<strong>nfluence, Outcomes, and Effects</strong></h4><p>Proposals should gradually improve each other, abstract ideas should be accepted first, later more concrete and later maybe even detailed plan with names.<br /><br />The process should produce high-quality decisions by design.

"<p><strong>Definition</strong></p><p>A new method for evaluating the efficiency of participation.</p><p><strong>Problems and Purpose</strong></p><p>Aims to lay the foundation for rigorous comparison of the efficiency of different participation methods by using the data itself. This has not been possible before.</p><p><strong>History</strong></p><p>Based on 40+ years’ experience of participation and community engagement. Key ideas are drawn from well-established principles in theoretical ecology and communication theory and so have a sound intellectual pedigree.</p><p><strong>Scope</strong></p><p>The new method, the Effective Number of Issues (ENI) appears to be applicable to any form of participation where there is a flow of information from participants to sponsor. It permits direct comparison of the efficiency of different participation methods. It can therefore be used for data-driven research into the factors that make for success (in the sense of greater efficiency) in participation.  </p><p><strong>Rationale and Description</strong></p><p>Around the world citizens like you and me are invited to participate in decisions about all sorts of things. What kind of digital future do we want? How do we spend our leisure time?  Where should new homes be built? How much local tax are we prepared to pay? What should future provision for the Arts be like? Where should a new waste incinerator be located? Of course it’s not only towns and cities who want information from us; it’s health providers, transport undertakings, central governments and a lot more besides.</p><p>One thing is certain: there is a lot of participation going on, using different processes to get our views as citizens, service users or consumers. There are traditional questionnaire surveys, focus groups, e-participation exercises, citizens’ juries, deliberative conferences, world cafés, town hall meetings – the list goes on and on.</p><p>Wouldn’t it be good if we knew how efficient these different processes were, and how well they perform their common task of communicating our views as citizens? And what if we could compare the efficiency of all these different processes in different circumstances?  That would be great, wouldn’t it?</p><p>I have developed a precise measure of the efficiency of consultation, participation and engagement processes which will enable us to do just that. Drawing on established ideas from ecology and communications theory, the key proposition is that the efficiency of a participation should be assessed in terms of the information flow it generates.</p><p>I have created a new tool for measuring this information flow. It is called the Effective Number of Issues (ENI) and adapts a technique ecologists use to measure the biodiversity of a community of plants or animals. If we think of the information flow as giving rise to a community of issues we can use the ENI to calculate the diversity of this community and thus the efficiency of the process.</p><p>To calculate the ENI you need a list of all the different issues that are used in, or emerge from, the participation process, and a count of the number of times each one appears. You also need the ENI formula, which is ENI = exp (H’), where H´= - ∑px ln (px). In this formula ‘p’ is the relative frequency of each issue and ‘ln’ is the natural logarithm. The calculations are quite straightforward using Excel and there is a step by step guide to the procedure here: <a href=""http://bit.do/calculateENI"">http://bit.do/calculateENI</a>.</p><p>Armed with the ENI we can now rate the efficiency of different participation processes, and explore what makes one process more efficient than another. As a start, Alfred Taudes, Hannes Leo and I have used the new tool to measure the efficiency of the idea generation stage of the Vienna Digital Agenda e-participation. (You can read more about this in the paper by May, Leo and Taudes). The ENI for this process (145.9) is the highest ever recorded. Unless, of course, you know of a participation process that can challenge Vienna for the top position? Do tell us!</p><p><strong>Secondary Sources</strong></p><p>May, J., Leo, H., Taudes, A.

"<h3>Definition</h3><p> </p><h3>Problems and Purpose</h3><p> </p><h3>History</h3><p> </p><h3>Participant Selection</h3><p> </p><h3>Deliberation, Decisions, and Public Interaction</h3><p dir=""ltr"">The preparation stage before really voting on the budget plan encompassed two major segments. First comes the determination of the total capital appointed to the public participatory budgeting plans before the formulation of concrete programs. To be specific, the township government would assess the annual financial resources and subtract basic expenditure as well as rigid spending from it, reaching the sum for public participatory budgets, which would be informed to the people’s councilors before handing-in the programs. Then comes the establishment of program pools. The way to raise the program and the proper persons who would be qualified to raise them involving in this part play crucial roles in deciding the depth of public participation in budgeting, and this is exactly where the subtle design of this model lies in—both government and peoples’ councilors are entitled to raise the programs but the dominant role is held by the people’s councillors. On principle, each councilor could raise no more than 2 programs at a time, and he/she should also report widely represented public opinion. Also, the township government could dispose government-led programs based on the local developmental plans, which could also enter the program pool after a thorough discussion at a government working meeting.</p><p dir=""ltr"">The segment of program review, including qualification review, formality examination and content checking, also stands out as one of the typical features in the Yanjin Model. To be concrete, the working panel in county government would organize or designate experts to investigate the practicability and political permission of the projects, providing a comprehensive review which would be sent to people’s councilors 10 days before the democratic meeting. Only those passing the examination would be presented to the democratic meeting for discussion and voting. It is worth noting that though the government basically dominated the checking process, it is the county government rather than the township government that took the lead role, avoiding the potential disturbance to public participation.</p><p>When the democratic meeting is finally held, the public discussion came to empower the peoples’ councilors with the determination right. The democratic meeting, attended by all the peoples’ councilors without any government officials, was regularly held twice a year, mainly functioning to make annual budget plans and examine the adjustments during the plan implementation. During the meeting, the peoples’ councilors would vote on the proper programs according to their preference after hearing the reasons and presentations on needs of funds. To ensure the efficiency and required order for the meeting, a host was selected randomly from the people to preside over the meeting, which is another unique feature of the Yanjin Model.</p><p dir=""ltr"">Besides the former preparation and voting stages, the subsequent implementation and feedback also calls for the public to join in. The peoples’ councilors would supervise the whole process of putting the budget plan into force and if the adjustments are needed, democratic meetings shall be held again to vote for approval. Apart from that, the financial department in county government would organize performance appraisal for the programs in the budget plan, which, together with the call report produced by township government, would be presented to all peoples’ councilors in the democratic meeting next year.<a href=""http://participedia.net/en/cases/participatory-budgeting-yanjian-county"">http://participedia.net/en/cases/participatory-budgeting-yanjian-county</a></p><h3>Influence, Outcomes, and Effects</h3><p> </p><h3>Analysis and Lessons Learned</h3><p> </p><h3>Secondary Sources</h3><p> </p><h3>External Links</h3><p> </p><h3>Notes</h3><p> </p>",en,4307,Yanjian Model of Participatory Budgeting

"<h3>Definition</h3><p>The ‘doparie’ is an Intra-Party Deliberative Referendum mechanism that is meant to improve the internal decision making process within parties in between elections.</p><h3>Problems and Purpose</h3><p>Raffaele Calabretta, a senior researcher at the Italian National Research Council developed this mechanism to be used by party members in between elections to deliberate, make decisions, and vote (Calabretta, 2010, 2011). The doparie are open to all the supporters of a party, and are centred in providing balanced information and promoting good deliberation. The doparie are designed to improve the communication between party members and voters, to increase accountability, and to allow parties to consult the base on difficult decisions that split the elected representatives (e.g., end of life laws).</p><h3>History</h3><p id=""p-59"">In December 2005, the proposal of doparies was first officially presented in the weekly magazine Avvenimenti (<a class=""xref-bibr"" href=""http://sgo.sagepub.com/content/early/2011/12/29/2158244011433699#ref-11"" id=""xref-ref-11-2"">Calabretta, 2005</a>). In December 2007, the spokesman for the Secretary of the Democratic Party (PD) Roberto Roscani commented as follows: “The proposal of doparies was read with attention and will be considered in the committee that has the task of preparing proposals for the Statute of the PD.” Article 27 of the Statute of the PD—approved on February 16, 2008, and amended by the National Assembly on May 21-22, 2010—provides for procedures similar to doparies (called “internal referenda”).</p><p id=""p-60"">In early March 2009, two articles on doparies written by Mario <a class=""xref-bibr"" href=""http://sgo.sagepub.com/content/early/2011/12/29/2158244011433699#ref-80"" id=""xref-ref-80-1"">Pirani (2009a</a>, <a class=""xref-bibr"" href=""http://sgo.sagepub.com/content/early/2011/12/29/2158244011433699#ref-81"" id=""xref-ref-81-1"">2009b</a>), one of the most prominent Italian journalists (<a class=""xref-bibr"" href=""http://sgo.sagepub.com/content/early/2011/12/29/2158244011433699#ref-82"" id=""xref-ref-82-1"">Pirani, 2010</a>), were published in the most important Italian newspaper, la Repubblica, followed by several other commentary articles in main national newspapers and by national public television interviews (e.g., <a class=""xref-bibr"" href=""http://sgo.sagepub.com/content/early/2011/12/29/2158244011433699#ref-13"" id=""xref-ref-13-1"">Calabretta, 2009a</a>, <a class=""xref-bibr"" href=""http://sgo.sagepub.com/content/early/2011/12/29/2158244011433699#ref-14"" id=""xref-ref-14-1"">2009b</a>).</p><p id=""p-61"">At the end of March 2009, the first congress of the right-wing party Il Popolo della Libertà (PDL) approved the statute of the party. Article 10 provides for electronic consultations on important decisions. (As already pointed out, doparies have to be preceded by a critical phase of study and debate, in which there is a reasoned exchange of different positions with regard to the subject of the dopary among a limited number of participants.)</p><p id=""p-62"">The proposal of doparies entered into all three motions of primaries’ congress of the PD in October 2009 (in the congress motion Marino, it is written as “primary and dopary party”; <a class=""xref-bibr"" href=""http://sgo.sagepub.com/content/early/2011/12/29/2158244011433699#ref-22"" id=""xref-ref-22-1"">Civati, 2009</a>). Close to the primaries of the PD, the media coverage of doparies had an international visibility through Miguel Mora in the Spanish newspaper El Paìs (<a class=""xref-bibr"" href=""http://sgo.sagepub.com/content/early/2011/12/29/2158244011433699#ref-69"" id=""xref-ref-69-1"">Mora, 2009</a>).</p><p id=""p-63"">In January 2010, the essay titled “Doparie dopo le primarie” (<a class=""xref-bibr"" href=""http://sgo.sagepub.com/content/early/2011/12/29/2158244011433699#ref-15"" id=""xref-ref-15-2"">Calabretta, 2010a</a>) was published, and then promoted all over the country. On December 20, 2010, doparies were described in the newspaper la Repubblica as “a system of democratic common sense wisdom” (<a class=""xref-bibr"" href=""http://sgo.sagepub.com/content/early/2011/12/29/2158244011433699#ref-21"" id=""xref-ref-21-1"">Ceccarelli, 2010</a>). In February 2011, the new center-right party Futuro e Libertà, born from the splitting of PDL held its constituent assembly and approved the first articles of the Statute, which speak of “peripheral participation in decision-making.” The party leaders have spoken from the stage of a technology platform, connected to the Internet, for members to vote on all decisions of the party (<a class=""xref-bibr"" href=""http://sgo.sagepub.com/content/early/2011/12/29/2158244011433699#ref-67"" id=""xref-ref-67-1"">Maurelli, 2011</a>).</p><p id=""p-64"">The widespread implementation of doparies could start from the bottom. On March 5, 2008, a civil list near the center-right at Bitonto, a large town near Bari, in southern Italy, brought the political agenda for administrative doparies (bitonto.myblog.it). On October 25, 2009, the same day when the national primary of the PD was conducted, the party leaders of Luino (Varese) decided to organize a sort of referendum on the decision of the municipal administration to build a wall along the lake. The consultation was open to all citizens and had a great turnout: About 15% more than the people who have voted in the primaries decided to express their opinion in the consultation, despite the requirement to make a double line (<a class=""xref-bibr"" href=""http://sgo.sagepub.com/content/early/2011/12/29/2158244011433699#ref-98"" id=""xref-ref-98-1"">Varese news, 2009</a>).</p><p id=""p-65"">In the uncertain situation of Italian politics at the end of 2010 and early 2011, characterized by mistrust from the side of electors to the major Italian parties, the secretaries of the PD of some towns in Sicily (Enna, Caltagirone, and Gela) organized a referendum open to members and electors on the decision of whether the party should continue to support the regional government. The initiative infected the other parties of the center-left wing, which called for a coalition regional consultation on the issue. Subsequently, Senator Enzo Bianco, a former Minister of Interior Affairs, through YouTube, gathered signatures of party members for a deliberative referendum based on Article 36 of the Statute of the Regional PD, which refers to Article 27 of the national statute. Some newspapers and blogs explicitly spoke of “doparies” (<a class=""xref-bibr"" href=""http://sgo.sagepub.com/content/early/2011/12/29/2158244011433699#ref-20"" id=""xref-ref-20-1"">Catania Politica, 2011</a>; <a class=""xref-bibr"" href=""http://sgo.sagepub.com/content/early/2011/12/29/2158244011433699#ref-26"" id=""xref-ref-26-1"">Condorelli, 2011</a>; <a class=""xref-bibr"" href=""http://sgo.sagepub.com/content/early/2011/12/29/2158244011433699#ref-49"" id=""xref-ref-49-1"">Giornale di Sicilia, 2011</a>; <a class=""xref-bibr"" href=""http://sgo.sagepub.com/content/early/2011/12/29/2158244011433699#ref-61"" id=""xref-ref-61-1"">L’Opinione, 2011</a>; <a class=""xref-bibr"" href=""http://sgo.sagepub.com/content/early/2011/12/29/2158244011433699#ref-79"" id=""xref-ref-79-1"">Pipitone, 2011</a>). A total of 5,000 signatures were then delivered by May 2, 2011: The regional leaders of the party indicated that referendum regulation would be approved in June 2011 and that what should be the first regional dopary would take place after the summer. In a press conference at the Chamber of Deputies, convened on April 14, 2011, to present to the press a new draft law on internal party democracy and discipline of primaries, the former secretary of the PD Walter Veltroni spoke in favor of the internal party referenda and specified that they could be subject to further regulation in political parties (<a class=""xref-bibr"" href=""http://sgo.sagepub.com/content/early/2011/12/29/2158244011433699#ref-42"" id=""xref-ref-42-1"">Fraschilla, 2011</a>).</p><p id=""p-66"">During the same period, young national political party leaders such as Giuseppe Civati and Sandro Gozi have publicly expressed on their Facebook profiles that they will organize the first national dopary on the theme of the political alliances of the PD, a topic that lacerates the party for years. In his book “Oltre i partiti” (“Beyond the parties”, 2011) the former coordinator of PD Goffredo Bettini has proposed to the center-left to open up to new forms of representation, in which the role of primaries and doparies would be crucial.</p><p id=""p-67"">It has to be verified whether the ordinary accomplishment of doparies in one of the two major Italian parties could have a contagious effect on the other political parties, as seems to be already happening: In March 2011, a consultation on nuclear energy was launched among the party members on the site of right-wing party Futuro e Libertà. In May 2011, Antonio Barile, a former mayor of San Giovanni in Fiore (Calabria, South Italy), committed himself to delivering doparies if reelected as mayor (PDL more civic lists). In Emilia Romagna, two regional leaders of Beppe Grillo’s Five Star Movement have brought their resignation in the face of public confronting a sort of referendum on the work that they carry out the election in the region (<a class=""xref-bibr"" href=""http://sgo.sagepub.com/content/early/2011/12/29/2158244011433699#ref-84"" id=""xref-ref-84-1"">Ponzano, 2011</a>). The decision on what should be their salary was also subjected to consultation. Did this participatory policy influence the movement’s local elections in Bologna on May 15, 2011, where the Five Star Movement scored a very good result (nearly 10% of the vote)? On June 24, 2011, Pierluigi Bersani, general secretary of PD, called and chaired the party’s national board focused on internal democracy; during the press conference, he announced that his party would soon organize the first party internal referendum (<a class=""xref-bibr"" href=""http://sgo.sagepub.com/content/early/2011/12/29/2158244011433699#ref-25"" id=""xref-ref-25-1"">Collini, 2011</a>).</p><p id=""p-68"">After 2 years since the appearance on Facebook, dopary pages have thousands of friends (of different political affiliations, right and left), in addition to the thousands who have signed the petition online (<a href=""http://www.petitiononline.com/doparie"">www.petitiononline.com/doparie</a>). On March 24, 2011, the proposal of doparies was presented at the library of the Italian Chamber of Deputies by invitation of the PD parliamentary group. It is gaining increased interest in Italy (see <a href=""http://doparie.it"">doparie.it</a> and <a href=""http://facebook.com/doparie"">facebook.com/doparie</a>) and beginning to be known in other countries: On May 27, 2011, the most widespread nonsports newspaper in Spain El Paìs has published a long article about primaries in Europe (<a class=""xref-bibr"" href=""http://sgo.sagepub.com/content/early/2011/12/29/2158244011433699#ref-50"" id=""xref-ref-50-1"">Gomez & Prades, 2011</a>), and doparies are the only new method mentioned.

"<h3>Definition</h3><p>While the concept of neighborhood groups advising government has been around for years, no city has incorporated such a system to the degree that Los Angeles has in terms of city structure and funding. The now 96 Neighborhood Councils (NCs) receive a yearly allocation of $37,000 and support from dedicated staff in the Department of Neighborhood Empowerment, the City Attorney’s Office and the City Clerk’s Office. NCs can formally weigh in on issues before the City Council via Community Impact Statements, which are printed on the City Council meeting agendas on whether or not a NC is supportive of an issue. They are the only entity inside and outside the City with that power.</p><h3>Problems and Purpose</h3><p> </p><h3>History</h3><p>In the late 1990’s, Los Angeles was facing a crisis as discontent neighborhoods across the city expressed their displeasure at being under-represented by city government. The most visible sign of alienation was the San Fernando Valley and Harbor areas secession movements. One alternative considered was increasing the fifteen City Council seats. There were concerns that City Council districts, at nearly a quarter-million people each, the largest in the nation, were too large to respond to many of the concerns of individual communities.</p><p>Rather than increase the existing representative democracy, the framers of the City Charter reform proposed a citywide Neighborhood Council (NC) system that they knew would be an experiment in participatory democracy. As one of the community members involved in the development of the system remembers, “It was damn exciting! We were creating an entirely new way for everyday people to be involved in city government, to change it for the better.” NCs were to be self-governing, independent advisory bodies to the City, and yet part of the City family as well. This presented not only a groundbreaking opportunity, but also an equally daunting challenge: how to cultivate grassroots democracy in one of the county’s most populous, most geographically vast and culturally diverse urban metropolitan centers, with a historically low level of civic participation.</p><h3>Participant Selection</h3><p> </p><h3>Deliberation, Decisions, and Public Interaction</h3><p>NCs have learned to be effective advocates in their community on land use, public safety, utility fees, sustainability issues, such as water conservation, City budget and any other matter affecting their community. In the past several years alone, they have defeated a sales tax increase (on the ballot) and a billion dollar bond for street repair (didn’t make it to the ballot) because the City failed to engage in sufficient community dialogue prior to proposing these matters. Through their alliances, they work with the Department of Water and Power where they negotiated the creation of a new City Rate Payer’s Advocate position to monitor rates; the Planning Department where they influence top City officials on sustainable building and zoning codes; and the Mayor’s Office where the NC Budget Advocates have worked collaboratively on City budget issues every year, including weighing in on union salary negotiations.</p><h3>Influence, Outcomes, and Effects</h3><p>The NCs are significant in redefining how government can effectively interact with its people to increase civic participation in a time when apathy is high. While Los Angeles saw a decrease in voter turnout the last several years, NCs are slowly pushing their numbers up with very little resources from 19,000 in 2012 to nearly 24,000 in 2014. As independent bodies, NCs can be innovative in ways to increase civic participation, such as using Nextdoor.com to increase online interactions with stakeholders, or using instant runoff voting in their elections. In 2016, they will pilot online voting citywide to increase voter turnout.</p><p>The transferability of the NC system has already been successful. The city of Nagoya, Japan, started their own neighborhood council system in 2010 based on their extensive study of Los Angeles’ system and their Mayor’s desire to increase civic participation in the community. In 2013, the White House Neighborhood Revitalization Initiative program in Memphis, Tennessee, started the Frayser Neighborhood Council using the bylaws and structure of Los Angeles’ NCs in order to address inequitable delivery of city services based on perceived race issues. Within their first year of operation, they were successful in raising awareness to vote down a tax increase in the community. Over fifty countries have come to learn about Los Angeles’ NC system. Many international visitors are stunned and envious of the way the NCs have persuaded city government to share power with them via a common voice created by the Neighborhood Council system.</p><h3>Analysis and Lessons Learned</h3><p> </p><h3>Secondary Sources</h3><p><a href=""http://participedia.net/en/cases/los-angeles-citywide-neighborhood-council-system"">http://participedia.net/en/cases/los-angeles-citywide-neighborhood-counc...</a></p><h3>External Links</h3><p> </p><h3>Notes</h3><p> </p>",en,4305,Neighborhood Councils
"<h3>Definition</h3><p>Online voting – or e-voting (electronic voting) – makes use of the Internet in order to cast a democratic vote. Online voting can be used in representative democratic systems in order to increase voter turnout in local, state or national elections or it can be part of democratic innovations like referendums. Moreover online voting is increasingly used within political organizations. Estonia is the most prominent example of a nation using online voting in parliamentary elections. It was the first country to use online voting in a national election in 2007 and has since incorporated online voting as an optional voting mechanism (besides regular paper ballot voting). The concept of <a href=""http://participedia.net/en/methods/liquid-democracy"">Liquid Democracy</a> created around the German Pirate Party is an example of a democratic innovation employing online voting. Different online platforms use the principles of Liquid Democracy by giving users the options to collectively write texts in wikis. Online voting is employed to express approval of alternative text versions. Liquid Democracy also makes use of <a href=""http://participedia.net/en/methods/delegated-voting"">delegated voting</a>, making votes transferrable to other, trusted people. Delegated voting (or proxy voting, absentee voting), a mechanism originally used to enable those who are unable to physically move to the ballot (because of sickness, old age etc.) to cast their vote through others, is currently expanding due to the possiblity of online voting.</p><h3>Problems and Purpose</h3><p>The overall purpose of online voting is to increase political participation. The use in elections in representative democracies aimes at countering democratic fatigue and apathy. Taking Estonia as an example, there are indicaters – however weak – that online voting might indeed have a positive effect on voter turnout, which has steadily increased at each national election from 58% in pre-online voting (2003) to currently 64.2% (2015). Increasing political participation is also the goal of democratic innovations and new participatory mechanisms in political organizations. Liquid democracy is mainly employed within Pirate Parties as a means to democratize party structures and create new horizontal, participatory political organizations. The idea that online voting can increase political participation is also at the heart of many technotopias of the 1990s, which invisioned an inclusive cyberdemocracy through the means of digital referendums. </p><p>Nevertheless, online voting is confronted with harsh criticism. Online voting heavily compromises the secrete ballot, one of the major priniciples of Western type democracies. If voting processes do not make use of public voting booths but rather take place in private homes, pressure of more dominant household members (mostly men) could be exerted on weaker ones. These worries, however, also affect postal voting. Online voting also opens possibilities for election fraud by governments or other bodies. While developers of online voting systems have generated intricate security systems, none of them can rule out fraud entirely. Once again, this is also true for paper ballot elections. The electronic mediation of elections, however, opens new possibilities for large scale fraud as voting results could theoretically be changed with a few mouse clicks.</p><h3>History</h3><p>Predecessors of online voting can be identified in the use of voting machines, which date back to the late 19th centruy in England and the US. The controversies surrounding online voting today are mirrored in the controversies surrounding this early use of voting machines. In the 1980s developments around the term teledemocracy made voting possible making use of tv sets via teletext. The discussion about electronic voting picked up momentum in the early 1990s through the increasingly popular access to the internet and the rapid development of the world wide web. The USA and Switzerland, relying on their experience in direct democracy, voting machines and postal voting, were among the forerunners of developing online voting. Somewhat surprisingly, Estonia was the first country to employ online voting in national pariamentary elections in 2007.</p><h3>External Links</h3><a href=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/37813811/ICEDEG2015_SwissEVoting.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAJ56TQJRTWSMTNPEA&Expires=1472040022&Signature=Fzf%2Fu4HC83aGYpoIvo1o7KRo4hs%3D&response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DFifteen_Years_of_Internet_Voting_in_Swit.pdf"">Serdült, Uwe, et al.

In an era where online access starts to become commonplace around the world, we are aware of how the internet changed the way we work, communicate and relate with each other. But politics and governments haven’t changed at all. So we set out to find a reliable way to hack the system. <br />Our first step was to create an open source, free software with an easy user experience for citizens to get informed, debate and vote on every single bill presented in Congress.DemocracyOS evolved to become one of the most used platforms for collaborative decision-making and it got translated into 15 languages. It has been used in Tunisia to debate its national constitution; by the Federal Government of Mexico to develops its open goverment policy; by the youngest parlamentarian in Kenya to consult his constituency or the Congress of Buenos Aires becoming the first experience on digital democracy in the American continent. <a href=""http://democracyos.org/"">http://democracyos.org/</a></p><h3>Participant Selection</h3><p> </p><h3>Deliberation, Decisions, and Public Interaction</h3><p> </p><h3>Influence, Outcomes, and Effects</h3><p> </p><h3>Analysis and Lessons Learned</h3><p> </p><h3>Secondary Sources</h3><p> </p><h3>External Links</h3><p> </p><h3>Notes</h3><p> </p>",en,4314,DemocracyOS

Firstly, the local bodies communicate the policy and budget guidelines to the communities via the Ward Committee (supposed to be elected authority but currently are run by the appointed bureaucrats). The community-based organisations, non-governmental organizations and other sectoral institutions such as the sub-health posts, schools, forest user's committees are invited by TLOs, WCFs, Community Mobilizers and alike to deliberate on the guidelines. The deliberation takes place in public places and any of the community member can participate and join the discussions. A local staff of the municipality is also present in these meetings. Experts, activists including the representatives of local political parties and advocates also take part in the process. </p><p>Then, the decisions of such deliberations are forwarded to the Ward Committee office which organizes a comprehensive workshop (Ward-Bhela) by inviting the selected representatives of community-based organizations where they justify, argue and defend their initial proposals made at the community level. These workshops are also attended by interested ordinary people, local officials, political representatives and media. Such deliberation can happen from few hours to many days. </p><p>Finally, the decisions of Ward-Bhela are then forwarded to the municipal/village secretariat. The municipality then reviews all the proposals. The reviewing process is relatively less open to public however a number of associated institutions such as the Budget Advisory Committee provide extensive feedback onto the proposals. After the revision (mainly from the perspectives of technicality and financial viability), the municipality then organises the meeting of Integrated Planning Formulation Committee (IPFC) which is comprised of all the representatives of communities, NGOs, sectoral organisations and so on. The IPFC deliberates on the refined proposals for many days before recommending the municipal council with the policies to be decided. In absence of elected authorities at the councils, the centrally appointed bureaucrat then endorses the decisions (exactly as is recommended by the IPFC).  </p><h1 class=""title""> </h1><p> </p><p> </p><h3>Influence, Outcomes, and Effects</h3><p> </p><h3>Analysis and Lessons Learned</h3><p> </p><h3>Secondary Sources</h3><p> </p><h3>External Links</h3><p> </p><h3>Notes</h3><p> </p>",en,4319,Nepalese Participatory Planning

"<strong>Citizen Budget</strong> is an innovative online tool used by over 65 cities to broaden their budget consultations beyond town halls and educate residents on the budget process.  Traditionally, governments, schools and other bodies have held public meetings to solicit feedback on their budgets. However, these public meetings have significant limitations: they are costly, attendance is limited or dominated by a few people/groups, and there are time restrictions on each person's participation. This customizable, inter-active budget simulator is at the cutting edge of online engagement and educates residents about government services, budget trade-offs and limits to government spending in a fun, user-friendly and dynamic way. It can also significantly increase the number of residents engaging in the budget process, providing municipalities with a wealth of information about their priorities.<p><strong>Citizen Budget simulator</strong> puts residents in the shoes of public administrators as they manipulate real numbers of the city budget and see the impacts to services and their taxes immediately. Through this easy exercise, residents deepen their appreciation of how municipal services are delivered and learn about the important trade-offs made by city leaders. The city receives the residents' submissions in aggregate, in a personalized dashboard with data available in an easy-to-use Excel download. ​</p><p> </p><h3>External Links</h3><p><a href=""http://www.citizenbudget.com/"">www.citizenbudget.com</a></p><p><a href=""http://www.opennorth.ca/"">www.opennorth.ca</a></p> <p> </p>",en,4327,Citizen Budget

"<h3>Problems and Purpose</h3><p>The European Citizens’ Initiative (ECI) is one of the EU’s political innovations aimed at fostering more direct and participatory democracy. As laid out in the Treaty of Lisbon, the ECI is unique in that it is one of the first transnational participatory instruments. In most European countries, citizens’ initiatives already exist at national, regional, and local levels, although they vary significantly in terms of their procedure and scope. The ECI allows citizens to address issues that cut across Member States.</p><p>The ECI is not the first participatory instrument in the EU. Before the creation of the ECI, the right to petition to the European Parliament was established under previous treaties. Petitions and initiatives differ in several ways. First,  petitions have no formal minimum number of signatures, nor do they require a broad base of support across multiple Member States. Second, petitions may be submitted by companies, organizations, and non-citizen residents. </p><p>The European Commission believes that the ECI is “widening up the sphere of public debate, allowing citizens to participate more intensively in the democratic life of the Union, through this new ‘participatory democracy’ tool.” </p><h3>History</h3><p>The legal basis of the ECI is laid out in the Treaty of Lisbon, which entered into force in December 2009 and amends the Maastricht Treaty (1992) and Treaty of Rome (1957). The Treaty of Lisbon reinforces the right of citizens to “participate in the democratic life of the Union” and outlines the details of the ECI.</p><p>The first initiatives were registered in early 2012.</p><p>In its formative stages, the right to initiative was advocated by the ECI Campaign, a grassroots coalition of democracy proponents and over 120 European NGOs. The group successfully lobbied for the inclusion of the ECI in the draft EU Constitution and Lisbon Treaty. Currently, the campaign monitors the implementation of the ECI, provides guidance to individuals and groups organizing initiatives, and examines how the framework can be ameliorated.</p><h3>Organizing Entities</h3><p>The ECI program is primarily overseen by the European Commission, the executive governing body of the EU. When an ECI is registered, it is the Commission that reviews the proposal and decides whether or not take the matter forward. In other words, a successful initiative with over 1 million signatures is not binding. No EU funding is provided to organizers of an ECI.</p><h3>Participant Selection</h3><p>The nature of the ECI means that participation is open to all EU citizens (i.e., nationals of a Member State); non-EU nationals cannot organize a citizens’ initiative, serve as members of a citizens’ committee, or submit a statement of support. To participate in any part of the process, citizens need to be old enough (though not necessarily registered) to vote in European Parliament elections – 18 years of age, except in Austria where the minimum age is 16.</p><p>Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) may be members of citizens’ committees but cannot be counted as one of the requisite 7 citizens, meaning that they may not be mentioned on the committee registration form.  Participants in the citizens' committees must residie in at least 7 different Member States.</p><h3>Deliberation, Decisions, and Public Interaction</h3><p>The first stage in the ECI process is the establishment of a citizens’ committee which must include residents from at least 7 Member States. This body, which cannot be run by formal organizations, must be composed of EU citizens old enough to vote. It is this committee that officially provides the wording of the proposed initiative to the Commission. The Commission then has two months to either register or reject the proposal. Rejection can be for a number of reasons, including the composition of the committee. The proposal can also be rejected where it falls outside the powers of the Commission, “is manifestly abusive, frivolous or vexatious”, or is “manifestly contrary to the values of the Union.” In its original formulation of the ECI, the Commission had suggested that registration should take place after a significant number of signatures have been collected to indicate that there is support for the proposal, but it was recognized that the rejection of an initiative at that point could cause considerable public disquiet.</p><p>If a proposal is registered and made public, the organizers have 12 months to collect 1 million signatures, formally called statements of support. Nationals of any Member State can sign a citizens’ initiative provided they are old enough to vote in the European Parliament elections. Statements of support may be collected in paper or online, but they must be registered on specific forms which comply with regulations. There was originally some disagreement between the Commission, Council and Parliament and those contributing to consultation on the ECI as to the minimum number of Member States from which signatures must be drawn. The final regulation states that signatures must come from at least one quarter of EU countries, or 7 out of 27. However, to ensure that the 1 million is reasonably representative – and not just from one or two Member States – the initiative must collect a minimum number of signatories from each of the 7 Member States. This threshold is directly proportional to the population of each Member State, following the proportions used for the number of MEPs (and multiplied by 750). Thus the minimum number of signatories from Malta is 4,500 compared to 74,250 from Germany.</p><p>Assuming the organizing committee has been able to collect the requisite number of signatures and fulfilled the relevant national thresholds, national authorities then have three months to verify the signatures from their polity. Assuming that the verification is successful, the organizing committee is then in a position to formally present the initiative to the Commission. The Commission has three months to respond, during which officials are expected to meet with the organizers to ensure the details of the proposal are understood and arrange a public hearing at the European Parliament. Having examined the proposal, the Commission is required to communicate an explanation of its response to the initiative, detailing the reasons behind its actions and other decisions. However, it is important to note that the Commission is not obliged to propose legislation as a result of an initiative, even if it collects enough signatures. The Commission's decision is not subject to an appeal procedure.</p><h3>Influence, Outcomes, and Effects</h3><p>The first ECI was symbolically registered by the Commission on Europe Day – May 9, 2012. This initiative, named <em>Fraternité 2020</em>, is a movement by the Young European Citizens’ Convention to enhance European exchange programs (such as Erasmus and the European Voluntary Service) and increase international solidarity. As of July 2012, six other ECIs had been officially registered, including:</p><ul><li><em>Stop Vivisection </em>(advocating animal rights and the protection of their welfare in scientific research)</li></ul><ul><li><em>Let Me Vote</em> (petitioning for the right of EU citizens living in another Member State to vote in all political elections in their country of residence)</li></ul><ul><li><em>One of Us</em> (arguing for the right to life from conception and denouncing the use of human embryos in research)</li></ul><ul><li><em>EU Directive on Dairy Cow Welfare</em> (supporting policies to improve the well-being of cows)</li></ul><ul><li><em>Right to Water</em> (advocating that access to sufficient and clean drinking water is a human right, and that management of water resources should not be liberalized)</li></ul><ul><li><em>Single Communication Tariff Act</em> (lobbying for the end of roaming fees across Europe)</li></ul><h3>Analysis and Lessons Learned</h3><p>In the official press release welcoming the speed of agreement between the European Parliament and Council on the realization of this new democratic innovation, Maroš Šefčovič, Vice-President for Inter-institutional Relations and Administration, stated: “The ECI will introduce a whole new form of participatory democracy to the EU. It is a major step forward in the democratic life of the Union. It's a concrete example of bringing Europe closer to its citizens. And it will foster a cross border debate about what we are doing in Brussels and thus contribute, we hope, to the development of a real European public space.”</p><p>The ECI is explicitly transnational in its ambition, requiring significant support – 1 million signatures – from citizens from across a number of Member States. It is this feature that distinguishes the ECI from the existing European Parliament Petition (EPP), which can be proposed by a single signatory. In addition, the ECI has been described as extremely innovative; it serves as the most direct route for citizens to influence the agenda-setting process at the highest levels of the EU. </p><p>The ECI has attracted some legitimate criticism. For one, some critics have decried the amount of personal data that citizens must provide on their statements of support. Signatories need to submit their full name, address, date and place of birth, nationality, and personal identification number (either a passport or identity card number). Regulations exist to ensure that these data are protected and properly used, but there are still respectable concerns about the process, especially with regards to the online collection system.</p><p>Just as importantly, many experts and advocates believe that the ECI should be made more citizen-friendly and workable. As opposed to national or regional movements, ECIs are necessarily transnational in scope, so campaigning becomes far more complex. Large geographic distances make it costly and challenging for citizens to meet and plan, let alone gather signatures. Language barriers also complicate the process, especially given that more than 20 official languages are spoken across the EU. Finally, as the ECI Campaign notes, “the absence of a strong common public space makes it almost impossible to make one’s voice heard Europe-wide through the media.”</p><p>The ECI Campaign has expressed satisfaction with the present success of the program, but it views the ECI as only the first step towards direct democracy and not as an end in itself. The group has identified some burdensome restrictions which it seeks to remove in 2015, when the ECI is officially reviewed. These proposed changes include:</p><ul><li>Simplifying the signature form. Concerns have arisen over privacy concerns and specifically the requirement for signatories to provide personal identification numbers.</li></ul><ul><li>Extending the time limit for signature collection from 12 to 18-24 months. The ECI Campaign believes one year is too short for smaller organizations without large budgets to raise awareness about issues that are not well understood by the general public.</li></ul><ul><li>Permitting ECIs to propose amendments to EU treaties. Currently, the Commission will not register initiatives which aim to achieve this, although the law on this issue may be open to challenge by the European Court of Justice.</li></ul><h3>Secondary Sources</h3><p>Citizens' Guide to the ECI: <a href=""http://ec.europa.eu/citizens-initiative/files/guide-eci-en.pdf"">http://ec.europa.eu/citizens-initiative/files/guide-eci-en.pdf</a></p><p>ECI Official Register: <a href=""http://ec.europa.eu/citizens-initiative/public/welcome"">http://ec.europa.eu/citizens-initiative/public/welcome</a></p><p>ECI FAQs: <a href=""http://ec.europa.eu/citizens-initiative/public/faq"">http://ec.europa.eu/citizens-initiative/public/faq</a></p><p>Description of EU Petitions: <a href=""http://www.europarl.europa.eu/aboutparliament/en/00533cec74/Petitions.html"">http://www.europarl.europa.eu/aboutparliament/en/00533cec74/Petitions.html</a></p><p>ECI Campaign: <a href=""http://www.citizens-initiative.eu/"">http://www.citizens-initiative.eu/</a></p><p>European Commission and the ECI: <a href=""http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/secretariat_general/citizens_initiative/index_en.htm"">http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/secretariat_general/citizens_initiative/index_en...</a></p><p>Treaty of Lisbon's ECI Regulations: <a href=""http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2011:065:0001:0022:EN:PDF"">http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2011:065:0001...</a></p><h3>Notes</h3><p>This article first appeared as a case study by Graham Smith.

"<h2><strong>Description of Black Sash CBM Model</strong></h2><p>Community-based monitoring (hereafter referred to as CBM) allows civil society to gather and analyse information from government service users’ points of view. It recognises that citizens are active holders of fundamental rights and not merely passive users of public services. As a result, CBM provides strong evidence to take back to government and, where necessary, into the public domain, in order to better the delivery of services where needed and to acknowledge good service where it is provided.</p><p>Black Sash, a non-governmental human rights organisation in South Africa, has initiated a CBM project, employing a participatory approach to build the capacities of citizens to partner with government to monitor local service delivery. The organisation, formed in 1955, works for the realisation of human rights, particularly socio-economic rights, and promotes open, transparent and accountable governance (see <a href=""http://www.blacksash.org.za/"">www.blacksash.org.za</a>). As outlined in the South African Constitution of 1996,<a href=""#_edn1"" name=""_ednref1"" title="""" id=""_ednref1"">[1]</a> the work of the Black Sash focuses on the right to social security and social protection for the most vulnerable groups, in particular, women and children, who are often the main beneficiaries of government services. They advocate for a strong and vibrant civil society comprised of community-based organisations, non-governmental organisations, coalitions and movements.</p><p>The core of the Black Sash CMB model is the formation of partnerships with both community-based organisations (CBOs) and government in order to strengthen the role of civil society in improving service delivery and holding public and private sectors to account. In empowering communities to participate in CBM, Black Sash is also promoting active citizenship. The CBM project seeks to encourage citizens to appraise the quality of services they receive at government facility level, express their concerns, and engage in dialogues to promote greater community participation in planning, implementation and monitoring of service delivery.</p><h2><strong>Process </strong></h2><p>The Black Sash CBM model involves seven key phases. Some of these phases run concurrently. The starting point is the setting up of infrastructural arrangements with government. Black Sash also creates partnerships with community-based Organisations (CBOs), building the capacity of these Community Partners (CPs) to engage in their own local-based monitoring exercises. Then they work to build a relationship with the local government facility and its managers. Once this is set up, the model moves into the next four phases of monitoring and data collection, analysing and cleaning data into reports, disseminating reports in the communities for reflection in dialogues where improvement plans are developed and adopted. The final phase is that of advocacy.  </p><p><u><em>Phase 1 - Establishing Government Relationships</em></u></p><p>Securing physical access to government departments and their service delivery facilities forms part of the groundwork of the overall monitoring project. Black Sash signed a memorandum of understanding with the Department of Performance Monitoring and Evaluation (DPME) supporting the CBM project undertaken by Black Sash in selected government departments such as the Department of Health and Local Government (municipalities) and the Department of Social Development. </p><p><u><em>Phase 2 - Selecting Community Partners</em></u></p><p>In this phase, Black Sash identifies community-based organisations (CBO’s) to participate in the CBM pilot project. The Black Sash regional staff schedule meetings with partners across all nine provinces and outlined the project concept, deliverables, timelines, roles and responsibilities. Black Sash takes great care in selecting the correct organisation with which to partner. They select community organisations on the basis of their capacity to engage and implement the project in their respective communities. Selected community organisations are required to enter into a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Black Sash. The MoU ensures mutual accountability by specifying the key roles and responsibilities for Black Sash, as well as the roles and responsibilities of the CBO’s taking part in the project. The MoU also establishes a normative framework of values and principles underpinning the overall monitoring project.</p><p>All monitors were also required to sign a Code of Conduct. Each monitor identified the day(s), within a specified timeframe, when they would monitor selected sites in the communities where they lived or worked. The Code of Conduct detailed various character and ethical guidelines, such as the importance of honesty, accuracy in reporting, objectivity, confidentiality, and sensitivity to different languages and contexts.</p><p><u><em>Phase 3 - Engaging Local Facilities</em></u></p><p>This step is about capacitating the local community organisation and supporting them through the local facility engagement. CBO’s are trained on the ethics of monitoring so that they would be able to guide respondents through a questionnaire without invalidating the responses.</p><p><u><em>Phase 4 - Monitoring the Facility</em></u></p><p>Monitoring takes place over a three month period each year and consists of light-touch surveys conducted by trained monitors. Each community organisation endeavours to survey at least 300 respondents per government facility in order to ensure accurate representation. Responses are captured directly onto the system via mobile or desktop tools, or else are transcribed from paper-based forms.</p><p><u><em>Phase 5 - Reporting the Findings</em></u></p><p>This step is concerned with the analysis and packaging of the survey results. Each site is analysed and their results presented back to them by means of high-impact posters which are put up at the public facility to give feedback to their service users. In addition, results are also packaged into a hand-out which is then used to plan the public dialogues with.</p><p><u><em>Phase 6 - Dialogues</em></u></p><p>Public dialogues are a platform for civil society, service users and management of the monitored government facilities to discuss the findings of the annual monitoring and together they will develop and adopt an improvement or action plan to address the concerns raised. This is a collaborative platform, facilitated by the community organisations, from which a joint monitoring committee (made up of community stakeholders and facility management and staff) should be established. The committee ensures the implementation of the improvement plan in the public facilities, particularly in areas where government is not delivering.</p><p><u><em>Phase 7 - Engaging in Advocacy</em></u></p><p>The final phase in the cycle of monitoring is advocacy. In this phase, the Black Sash and community organisations attend to the larger issues that emerged out of the survey results and public dialogues. It is often the case that issues raised at a local level need provincial or even national interventions in order to address the systemic concern. Here, Black Sash also encourages other stakeholders with similar interests to engage with government departments to find practical solutions to the service delivery problems and challenges raised in the surveys.</p><h2><strong>Benefits of the model</strong></h2><p>Community-Based Monitoring (CBM) model is designed to benefit and involve government service users. The model helps to build constructive, democratic state-society relations between officials and community-based organisations who collaborate with community members on monitoring and future planning to improve the performance of public service centres.</p><br clear=""all"" /><p><a href=""#_ednref1"" name=""_edn1"" title="""" id=""_edn1"">[1]</a> Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996 (Act 108 of 1996).</p><h2><strong>External Links </strong></h2><p><a href=""http://www.blacksash.org.za/"">http://www.blacksash.org.za/</a></p><p><a href=""http://www.dpme.gov.za/Pages/default.aspx"">http://www.dpme.gov.za/Pages/default.aspx</a></p><p> </p>",en,4357,The Black Sash Model of Community Based Monitoring (CBM)

<p>Definition:</p>
<p>Ecosystem-based management (EBM) is a concept that links human and ecological systems through adaptive management approaches. Generally, EBM promotes human well-being by managing for the coexistence of &quot;healthy, fully functioning ecosystems and human communities&quot; (CIT, 2004, pg. 9). EBM is also theorized to be collaborative insofar as it fosters participation and encourages respect for the diverse values and aspirations of communities. Moreover, Parsons (2015) suggests this management paradigm exhibits various &quot;ecological&#039;, &#039;managing uncertainty&#039;, and &#039;social&#039; principles.</p>
<p>Principles of EBM (Adapted from Parsons, 2015, pg. 23)</p>
<p>1. Ecological</p>
<p>Maintain Ecological Integrity: Ecological Integrity is the abundance and diversity of organisms at all levels, and the ecological patterns, processes, and structural attributes responsible for that biological diversity and for ecosystem resilience (CIT, 2004, pg.13).</p>
<p>Ecological Boundaries: Management that recognizes and follows ecological boundaries such as watershed boundaries is more effective at maintaining ecological integrity of an ecosystem than management that follows political (jurisdictional boundaries)</p>
<p>Hierarchical Context: It is essential that managers make connections between patterns and processes at all scales within an ecosystem, including site, neighbourhood, ecosystem, and regional scales and species, population, ecosystem, and watershed levels of analysis.</p>
<p>2. Managing Uncertainty</p>
<p>Data Collection: Data collection involves collection of both social and ecological data to establish the condition of an ecosystem and to implement monitoring (Slocombe, 1998a).</p>
<p>Monitoring: Monitoring involves identifying and using data and indicators of change to characterize ecosystem status and maintenance/improvement of health.</p>
<p>Adaptive Management: Adaptive Management is a systematic and iterative approach for improving resource management by emphasizing learning from management outcomes (Bormann, Haynes, &amp; Martin, 2007). Adaptive management involves testing assumptions and exploring alternatives. Data collection and monitoring can be seen as components of the adaptive management cycle</p>
<p>3. Social</p>
<p>Interagency Cooperation: In conjunction with the principle of managing through ecological boundaries, governments, non-governmental organizations, and citizens will need to work together to implement components of EBM.</p>
<p>Organizational Change: The structures of land management agencies and their operations may need to change, for example by forming interagency committees, or changing professional norms and shifting power dynamics.</p>
<p>Humans Embedded in Nature: Humans need to acknowledge their impact and dependence on ecological patterns and processes.</p>
<p>Values: Acknowledge the role that humans play in ecosystem management goals, even in the presence of adequate scientific information.</p>

Tanto a Câmara dos Deputados quanto o Senado Federal dispõem, em seus respectivos Regimentos Internos, sobre as regras e procedimentos para realização de audiências públicas (RICD, art. 255 a 258; RISF, arts. 93 a 95). Em ambos os casos o expediente é considerado uma forma das comissões parlamentares instruírem matéria legislativa em trâmite, bem como tratarem de assuntos de interesse público relevante.Não há consenso em relação a uma definição de audiência pública na literatura acadêmica especializada, mas da forma como vêm sendo praticadas nas casas legislativas brasileiras as APs consistem em reuniões abertas promovidas pelas comissões parlamentares, das quais podem participar legisladores, cidadãos, representantes de entidades da sociedade civil, técnicos e especialistas com o objetivo de promover o debate em torno de tema ou questão de interesse público na área da respectiva comissão.No Poder Judiciário, particularmente, a previsão de audiências públicas no campo de ação do Supremo Tribunal Federal (STF) remete à publicação da Lei nº 9.868, de 1999, devendo ser referida também a Lei 9882/99 – a primeira regulamenta a Ação Direta de Inconstitucionalidade (ADI) e a Ação Declaratória de Constitucionalidade (ADC) e a segunda trata da Arguição de Descumprimento de Preceito Fundamental (ADPF). Com isso, estabeleceu-se a previsão de realização de APs no âmbito do exercício do controle concentrado de constitucionalidade, por convocação do Presidente da Corte ou do Relator do processo e com a participação de membros da sociedade civil, para fins de esclarecimento de matéria ou circunstância de fato. O Regimento Interno do Supremo Tribunal Federal (RISTF)[3], em seu art. 13, incisos XVII e XVIII, prevê a possibilidade de convocação de audiência pública, pelo Presidente da Corte, para “ouvir o depoimento de pessoas com experiência e autoridade em determinada matéria, sempre que entender necessário o esclarecimento de questões ou circunstâncias de fato, com repercussão geral e de interesse público relevante, debatidas no âmbito do tribunal”. Dispõe, ademais, no parágrafo único, incisos II e III do art. 154, sobre a competência do Ministro-Relator para convocar a AP, estabelecendo que deverá ser garantida a participação das diversas correntes de opinião e que a ele toca a decisão sobre a seleção das pessoas que serão ouvidas, divulgação da lista dos habilitados, determinação da ordem dos trabalhos e fixação do tempo de que cada um disporá para se manifestar. Por fim, também por determinação regimental (art. 154, parágrafo único, IV a VII), prevê-se que as audiências públicas serão transmitida pela TV Justiça e pela Rádio Justiça, que os trabalhos da audiência pública serão registrados e juntados aos autos do processo, quando for o caso, ou arquivados no âmbito da Presidência, e que os casos omissos serão resolvidos pelo Ministro que convocar a audiência.Há, portanto, procedimentos formais, regras que envolvem a formalização da AP (data e hora definidas, pauta clara, atas das sessões, gravação em vídeo e/ou voz), e a condução do debate (determinação de quais atores possuem a palavra, seu tempo de fala, dinâmica da interação). Em geral, as APs começam com uma fala de abertura do relator, que cede a palavra para o representante do Ministério Público apresentar suas considerações. A partir daí, os expositores se manifestam um a um de acordo com a ordem previamente estabelecida. <h3>Problems and Purpose</h3>Contemporaneamente, as Cortes Constitucionais são ora tomadas como lócus da razão pública (Dworkin, 2010), ora são destacadas como um interlocutor institucional (Mendes, 2009; Bateup, 2006), ora são caracterizadas por sua própria capacidade de deliberar (Ferejohn & Pasquino, 2002, 2004). Particularmente, o relevo que o liberalismo contemporâneo empresta à capacidade argumentativa das Cortes (Dworkin, 2010) e a correlata ideia de que o direito retira sua legitimidade de uma cultura de justificação (Sachs, 2009; Woolman & Bishop, 2008), a qual é parte fundante de democracias genuínas (Mendes, 2014), reposiciona a atuação das Cortes no interior de uma cadeia decisória deliberativa (Ferenjohn & Pasquino, 2004; Bateup, 2006; Mendes, 2009). Por outro lado, pressupõe-se que as Cortes Constitucionais sejam afetadas pelo ambiente político que as circunda (Friedman, 2009) e busquem ser responsivas em face do que circula na esfera pública ampliada. A questão da legitimidade democrática das Cortes ganha, portanto, novos contornos, vinculada à sua capacidade de inserir-se em uma dinâmica deliberativa interinstitucional e, também, socioestatal, além de apresentar capacidade deliberativa interna, beneficiando-se de sua peculiar condição decisória (Edwards, 2003). Nesse quadrante, as audiências públicas – que florescem na jurisdição constitucional brasileira – representam uma inovação institucional com potencial para realinhar o debate acerca da legitimidade democrática das Cortes Constitucionais, pela ampliação da inclusão que promovem, sob o ponto de vista da integração de atores, mas também de argumentos epistêmicos (Landemore, 2015) que têm aparecido especialmente nos debates de fundo moral. Isso depende, contudo, da sua capacidade de promover deliberação interna à Corte, fomentar o diálogo interinstitucional (Tulis, 2003; Mendonça & Amaral, 2014; Steiner et al, 2004) e, ainda, funcionar como uma espécie de interface socioestatal (Isunza & Hevia, 2006).  Do modo como vêm sendo praticadas pelo STF, ainda que possuam regras específicas para o seu funcionamento, as APs variam tanto em relação ao seu formato, considerando a ampla liberdade que o relator tem para definir não somente quem participará, mas também as regras de interação entre os expositores, quanto em face de seus possíveis seus usos e efeitos. <h3>History</h3>Desde 2007, o STF realizou audiências públicas sobre os mais diversos temas, tanto em sede de ADIs e ADPFs, quanto em sede de RExt. Precisamente, entre 2007 e 2014, o STF realizou 15 (quinze) audiências públicas. Com exceção de uma – que versou sobre a importação de pneus usados – todas as demais se encontram parcial ou totalmente documentadas no portal do tribunal. [4]No que diz respeito à incidência geral das audiências públicas na jurisdição constitucional pode-se dizer que o uso desse mecanismo institucional vem se intensificando ao longo dos anos, não apenas no âmbito das ações constitucionais – casos em que o STF atua como Corte Constitucional, propriamente – mas, também, quando atua como instância recursal do poder judiciário, embora globalmente ainda seja um recurso de exceção. Ao longo dos anos a utilização das APs tornou-se mais frequente: se nos cinco primeiros anos (de 2007 a 2011) realizaram-se 05 (cinco) APs, nos últimos dois anos, já foram realizadas 09 (nove), com destaque para o ano de 2013, quando foram realizadas 07 (sete) APs. [5]<br />As APs no STF, contudo, possuem um caráter pontual quando se considera o total de processos que chegam ao STF, e destes, o total que envolve o controle de constitucionalidade – seja em sede de Recurso Extraordinário, seja pelo julgamento de ações diretas. Nota-se que o recurso à AP é uma exceção, provavelmente mobilizado para a resolução de casos considerados mais complexos e controversos pela Corte. As questões que envolvem a realização das APs são não apenas complexas, do ponto de vista jurídico, mas impactam profundamente a agenda pública nacional. Basta que se mencione que pelos menos duas APs – pesquisas com célula tronco embrionárias e aborto em caso de anencefalia - envolveram o debate em torno do “direito à vida” que extrapola as fronteiras da dogmática constitucional e se encontra com os discursos (e lutas) mais contemporâneos do feminismo. Vale mencionar que ainda de forma mais direta, o STF realizou audiência pública em meio à disputa em torno do “Mais Médicos” – um dos principais programas do governo federal na área de saúde, durante o primeiro mandato da Presidente Dilma Rousseff. Ainda na área da saúde, outras duas APs foram convocadas, para que diretamente fossem debatidos aspectos da política pública nesse campo, particularmente relacionados com o Sistema Único de Saúde - SUS. A ação afirmativa racial, que previa reserva de vagas no ensino público superior também não escapou das considerações do STF e, mais uma vez nesse caso, uma AP foi convocada. Ademais, questões ambientais foram objeto de escrutínio no âmbito de ações constitucionais que mereceram a realização de APs: importação de pneus usados, campo eletromagnético, queimadas, proibição do uso de amianto. Por fim, realizou-se AP no âmbito da ação constitucional que tratava do sistema de financiamento de campanhas no Brasil, aspecto central de disputa política no contexto democrático atual.<h3>Participant Selection</h3>Cada vez que uma AP é convocada a Corte divulga em seu sítio eletrônico uma síntese das regras de participação. Existem três modalidades de participação: (1) como parte da plateia sem direito a qualquer manifestação; (2) enviando sugestões; e (3) como expositor na audiência, caso em que é necessária inscrição prévia e deferimento pelo relator. No primeiro caso, o limite para participação é a capacidade do local de realização[6] e os lugares são ocupados por ordem de chegada, respeitada a reserva aos expositores e à imprensa. No segundo caso, admite-se que qualquer pessoa ou entidade, independentemente de inscrição, encaminhe documentos úteis ao esclarecimento das questões a serem debatidas na AP, pela via impressa ou eletrônica.[7] O terceiro e mais importante caso versa sobre os expositores da AP, os quais são indicados pelas partes do processo, por órgãos e entes estatais e entidades da sociedade civil ou pelos interessados que requerem sua participação (especialistas habilitados)[8].  Destacam-se aqui outras características das APs, considerando, particularmente as regras de participação dos expositores. As APs possuem um caráter presencial, ou seja, não podem ser realizadas pela internet e permitem um intercâmbio documental bastante restrito, privilegiando a manifestação oral dos participantes, com o intuito de promover um debate em torno da questão controversa. Ademais, embora seja possível a participação de atores individuais – especialmente como expectadores – privilegia-se a participação de caráter coletivo. Mais de 400 expositores já participaram de APs no STF. Os expositores podem ser classificados de acordo com a origem da sua indicação: (1) agentes estatais, indicados por um dos três poderes da República, ou o representante do Ministério Público, ou (2) sociedade civil, representantes de associações profissionais, entidades de classe, sociedades médicas, movimentos sociais, frentes, conselhos de políticas públicas, associações de tipos e formas de organização variadas voltadas para a ajuda mútua e defesa de causas, ou, ainda, (3) especialistas, que não se apresentam como “falando em nome de” ou expondo uma posição oficial das instituições e entidades das quais faziam parte, amparando-se a participação na expertise acumulada pelo expositor, seja como estudioso ou pesquisador do tema debatido, seja como ocupante de cargos em instituições importantes na área.O número de expositores por AP varia bastante, mas registra-se uma maior participação, em termos quantitativos, de expositores indicados por associações ou coletivos da sociedade civil: as organizações sociais representam 37% do total de participantes, seguida dos especialistas que correspondem a 30%. Dentre os agentes estatais, os indicados pelo Poder Executivo foram os mais presentes, estando ausentes apenas da primeira AP, realizada no ano de 2007. Representantes do Poder Legislativo estiveram presentes em 10 APs, sendo oriundos, majoritariamente, da Câmara dos Deputados, particularmente nas situações em que haviam sido autores das leis debatidas ou relatores de projetos de lei relacionados ao tema em discussão. Em relação à esfera de atuação, há predomínio de representantes de instituições situadas no nível nacional: 67% atuam no nível nacional, 29,3% representantes de órgãos e instituições de abrangência estadual e de apenas 3,7% da esfera municipal, considerando tanto os agentes estatais quanto os representantes da sociedade civil. Esse predomínio pode ser explicado pela natureza – constitucional – das questões em debate, relacionando-se com a própria divisão constitucional de competências que coloca nas mãos do poder central a maior parte das responsabilidades e atribuições em uma ampla gama de temas e assuntos. Por outro lado, o perfil dos participantes varia conforme a temática tratada, se relaciona com a distribuição de competências entre os entes federados e com a origem da ação que desencadeou o processo, e está associado às escolhas feitas pelas partes, responsáveis pela indicação dos expositores, e pelos ministros, responsáveis pelo deferimento e indeferimento das solicitações o que impacta, diretamente, na concepção de sociedade civil adotada em cada caso.<h3>Deliberation, Decisions, and Public Interaction</h3>A grande liberdade atribuída regimentalmente ao ministro-relator para que decida, discricionariamente, acerca das pessoas que serão ouvidas, a ordem dos trabalhos e o tempo reservado para cada expositor, associada ao fato de que por reiteradas vezes os relatores exerceram algum tipo de controle sobre o conteúdo das exposições, limita a capacidade dos expositores para incluir tópicos na agenda e tampouco dar-lhes o tratamento desejado, o que pode restringir o potencial caráter deliberativo das APs.Registram-se, ainda, limitações quanto à possibilidade de interação entre os participantes, inviabilizando o intercâmbio regulado de razões com vistas à apresentação e à justificação de posições e à persuasão mútua. É possível reconhecer pelo menos quatro cenários diferentes de interação nas APs: (1) apresentação dos expositores, sem intervenções durante ou ao final da audiência; (2) apresentação dos expositores, sem intervenções durante ou ao final da audiência, mas com perguntas dos ministros ao final; (3) apresentação dos expositores, com intervenções pontuais para pergunta/esclarecimento do representante do MP ou do relator; (4) apresentação dos expositores, com possibilidade de intervenção do representante do MP, advogado da arguente e relator ao final de cada exposição para perguntas e esclarecimentos.De modo geral, o formato das audiências faz com que elas se assemelhem mais a uma arguição do que a um debate propriamente dito. Em nenhum caso foi permitido aos participantes dirigirem a palavra uns aos outros sob o argumento de que se tratava de uma audiência de caráter instrutório e mesmo as menções de um expositor à fala ou argumentação de outro eram reguladas. Ainda assim, verifica-se certo intercâmbio indireto de ideias e troca de informações, pois os participantes envolvidos parecem já conhecer os principais argumentos uns dos outros e reforçá-los ou questioná-los com a apresentação de outros argumentos e evidências.<h3>Influence, Outcomes, and Effects</h3><p>No que se refere aos ganhos informacionais proporcionados pelas APs, verifica-se que ao longo dos trabalhos, os participantes contribuíram para a abordagem do tema a partir de diversas perspectivas, ampliando-se o volume, a variedade e a qualidade da informação. As exposições não se restringiram ao tradicional domínio jurídico, estendendo-se a questões técnicas e interdisciplinares, seja porque foi produzido suficiente material para subsidiar a decisão da corte tanto no que diz respeito aos possíveis prognósticos em relação às consequências, implicações e repercussões práticas da legislação discutida, impactos específicos sobre determinados grupos ou acertos em relação a valores fundamentais dos indivíduos e da sociedade brasileira. </p><h3>Analysis and Criticism</h3>Entre 2007 e 2014 o STF fez um uso crescente do mecanismo das audiências públicas para ouvir a opinião de especialistas e representantes de instituições estatais e organizações civis a respeito de temas de grande relevância, complexidade e que envolviam intensa controvérsia pelos potenciais impactos nos campos jurídicos, político, social, econômico e cultural. Genericamente, os ministros do Supremo Tribunal Federal associam às audiências públicas grandes expectativas quanto à ampliação da legitimidade das decisões da Corte, assim como quanto aos ganhos informacionais propiciados pelo mecanismo ao processo decisório, embora nem sempre vinculem uma variável à outra. Contudo, parece haver grande distância entre o discurso e prática quando se considera a forma como as APs vêm sendo empregadas, muito aquém de suas potencialidades, particularmente em face ao grau elevado de discricionariedade do relator, com consequências negativas em termos de garantia quanto à inclusão equânime das partes.Considerando as evidências reunidas sobre o número e o perfil dos participantes das APs no STF destaca-se o potencial desse mecanismo para funcionar como uma importante interface socioestatal, na medida em que conecta atores e instituições e propõem a efetiva conexão de um discurso público mais amplo levado a cabo em uma grande multiplicidade de esferas e arenas. Embora tenha sido possível perceber um processo de institucionalização das APs, expresso pela alteração do Regimento Interno do Supremo Tribunal Federal (RISTF) e pela reiteração de um conjunto de práticas envolvidas na condução das audiências, a análise sugere que várias das diferenças identificadas entre os eventos devem ser explicadas mais pelo grau de adesão, pelas crenças, percepções e escolhas dos ministros do que por outros fatores como tema ou momento de realização da AP, o que expressa a enorme discricionariedade do relator e sua posição privilegiada na rede de atores envolvidos na construção do diálogo interinstitucional e socioestatal. Esta discricionariedade aponta, portanto, para a ausência de garantias institucionais para a inclusividade no processo. O acentuado caráter instrutório de que ainda se revestem as APs, a rigidez na condução dos trabalhos por parte dos relatores, o baixo nível de interação dialógica entre as partes e o caráter sobejamente técnico-científico dos discursos são, sem dúvida, aspectos que contribuem para esse quadro. Vale lembrar, contudo, que houve avanço, quando se considera, comparativamente, as APs. Exemplarmente, as audiências públicas referentes ao debate acerca da constitucionalidade das pesquisas com células-tronco embrionárias e da interrupção da gravidez em casos de anencefalia – cujos debates morais de fundo são similares – apresentaram diferentes padrões de inclusividade, sendo essa última muito mais plural quanto ao tipo de atores, linguagens e formatos discursivos.Por outro lado, as APs realizadas entre 2007 e 2014 variaram tanto em relação ao tipo de controle de constitucionalidade exercido pelo STF, quanto no que diz respeito aos autores/recorrentes envolvidos nos processos que deram origem a elas. No âmbito do controle concentrado, as APs foram realizadas, em sua maioria, em ações de autoria de entidades representativas da sociedade (Partidos Políticos, Sindicatos, entidades de representação de classe e outras associações civis legitimadas para a propositura de ações diretas de constitucionalidade). Inverte-se essa relação quando se observa o universo de recursos extraordinários: nesse caso, que se vincula ao controle difuso de constitucionalidade, as APs realizadas envolviam recursos de autoria de entes estatais (Presidência da República, Governadores de Estados, Mesas do Senado Federal, da Câmara de Deputados e das Assembleias Legislativas, e Ministério Público).Ademais, as APs realizadas pelo STF trataram dos mais diversos assuntos, tais como direito à vida, proteção ao consumidor, princípio da isonomia, liberdade econômica e livre iniciativa, direito à saúde, dignidade da vida e da saúde do trabalhador, defesa do meio ambiente, entre outros. Os eventos foram convocados por diversos ministros. Desde que se realizou a primeira AP, em abril de 2007, o STF já alterou a sua composição sete vezes. Ao todo, atuaram na Corte entre 2007 e 2014, 17 (dezesete) ministros. Destes, 07 (sete) convocaram audiências públicas: Ayres Britto e Ricardo Lewandowski convocaram uma, cada um; Gilmar Medes, Carmen Lúcia e Dias Toffoli convocaram duas, cada um; Marco Aurélio Mello convocou três e Luiz Fux convocou cinco audiências públicas, ainda que tenha tomado posse apenas em 2011. [9]Considerando que os relatores têm discricionariedade para decidir quando convocar ou não uma AP, podemos supor que alguns ministros tenham maior simpatia à novidade institucional do que outros, particularmente quando se observa tamanha variação no tocante ao tipo de controle de constitucionalidade no âmbito do qual as APs foram realizadas, às temáticas envolvidas e aos tipos de autores/recorrentes, como forma de aferir os interesses do estado e da sociedade.As razões expressas nos editais de convocação, por sua vez, remetem ora à qualidade da questão envolvida, destacando sua relevância (jurídica, econômica e social) e natureza controversa, ora ao potencial da própria AP para aplacar os desafios impostos pela construção de uma decisão que é fundamental e envolve um debate que suscita “enfoques diversificados”, numerosos questionamentos, múltiplos entendimentos e várias controvérsias. Associado ao reconhecimento do potencial informacional das APs os editais de convocação são explícitos quanto aos ganhos de legitimidade esperados com a realização do evento, o que também é recorrente nas manifestações dos ministros ao longo das audiências. As falas de abertura e de encerramento das sessões têm funcionado como um momento de reflexão em torno da AP, particularmente em relação aos seus objetivos, às expectativas associadas à sua realização e ao seu significado, seja para o STF, seja para a democracia brasileira.A noção de participação popular, de ouvir “o povo”, “a sociedade” é bastante mobilizada também por representantes do Ministério Público, presentes nas seções, e por muitos daqueles que participavam como expositores. A percepção dos ministros – e expositores – acerca do potencial das audiências públicas no âmbito da jurisdição constitucional parece se fundamentar em um tripé conceitual: legitimidade, participação e informação. A legitimidade democrática do processo decisório se aprofunda pela participação que as audiências públicas promovem, na medida em que se produzem decisões mais bem informadas, considerando não apenas a complexidade técnica das questões envolvidas, mas também o pluralismo moral e as múltiplas perspectivas políticas presentes em sociedade. Evidencia-se, aí, outra característica das audiências públicas: elas possuem um caráter consultivo, pois abrem a possibilidade para que segmentos da sociedade possam se expressar e propor soluções, embora caiba aos ministros acatar ou não as propostas. <p> </p><h3>Secondary Sources</h3><p>AJOUZ, Igor; ALMEIDA, Cecília.

Último acesso em 20/02/2014. [5]Em 2015, foram realizadas 02 (duas) APs não incluídas nesta análise: uma convocada pelo Ministro Luís Roberto Barroso para subsidiar o julgamento da ADI 4.439, que discute os modelos de ensino religioso em escolas públicas e a outra, convocada pelo ministro Gilmar Mendes, para tratar do “uso de depósito judicial”. [6]Em alguns casos, havendo superlotação do local, o Tribunal disponibiliza uma segunda sala para alocar os participantes com transmissão simultânea da AP por meio de telões.[7]O portal do STF disponibiliza, para algumas audiências públicas, textos, documentos e sugestões enviados por instituições e organizações sociais interessadas no tema.[8]Os órgãos e entidades interessadas em indicar especialistas e os amici curiae precisam se inscrever para participar da audiência dentro dos prazos estipulados no edital de convocação. O requerimento de inscrição como expositor deve ser acompanhado do currículo do especialista, bem como do resumo da tese e da posição a ser defendida. [9]Vale a pena destacar que a Audiência Pública realizada em junho de 2015 foi convocada pelo Min. Barroso que, curiosamente, atuou como advogado de entidade civil, interveniente no processo em que se realizou a primeira AP no STF, em 2007.  ",en,4395,Audiências Públicas no Supremo Tribunal Federal
"<p>1st version 05/16 by Eleonora Schettini M. Cunha, UFMG, Brazil.</p><h3>Definition<img alt="""" src=""http://i.imgur.com/br92J5A.png?3"" /></h3>Os conselhos de políticas públicas[1] são estruturas político-institucionais permanentes vinculados à estrutura administrativa do Estado brasileiro, em seus três níveis de governo (União, estados e municípios) e relacionados a uma área de política pública. Eles são híbridos em sua composição – representantes do governo, da sociedade civil e, em alguns casos, do mercado – e contam com uma estrutura burocrática de apoio ao seu funcionamento. A lei que institui o conselho estabelece a sua natureza, as especificidades de sua composição, bem como os objetivos e os parâmetros de sua estrutura e seu funcionamento.  <h3>Problems and Purpose</h3>No processo de redemocratização do Brasil, após a ditadura militar (1964-1985), havia uma forte demanda dos movimentos sociais e de diversas organizações da sociedade civil pela ampliação dos espaços e oportunidades de participação democrática e pela possibilidade efetiva da sociedade participar da definição das políticas públicas. Os conselhos despontaram como um dos diferentes espaços que possibilitariam viabilizar a participação da sociedade na formulação e no controle sobre as ações públicas e os resultados de políticas públicas. Eles têm sido instituídos em diferentes áreas de políticas públicas (como saúde, assistência social, meio ambiente, educação, patrimônio público, políticas urbanas) com diferentes finalidades, que podem ser combinadas entre si: consultiva, quando instruem e assessoram os governos em suas decisões; normativa, quando estabelecem normas que organizam a política; deliberativa, quando suas decisões são vinculantes; e fiscalizatória, quando têm poder de monitoramento e controle da política (Buvinich, 2014). Seu foco é a gestão de bens públicos, o estabelecimento de diretrizes e estratégias de ação, a definição de prioridades (inclusive orçamentárias), a regulação e a normatização das ações de determinada área de política pública e o controle público sobre o Estado (Cunha, 2013). <h3>History</h3>No Brasil, verifica-se a existência de conselhos como meio de apoio ao exercício do poder político-administrativo desde o Século XIX. No Império, os conselhos eram compostos por membros da elite intelectual, política e econômica e visavam a conciliar as decisões governamentais com os interesses dessa elite. No início do Século XX, a área previdenciária experimentou processos de participação institucionalizada que admitiram representantes dos trabalhadores, mas áreas como Educação, Saúde, Economia e Finanças, Assistência Social e Indústria e Comércio instituíram conselhos consultivos compostos prioritariamente por notáveis e, em alguns deles, havia representação corporativa ou de interesses privados. Em meados do século os conselhos de âmbito nacional adquiriam características de especialização técnica, como o da Educação, que passou a normatizar a área, definindo aspectos relevantes dessa política. O advento da ditadura militar não só manteve os conselhos na estrutura do Estado brasileiro como ampliou o seu número (de 2, em 1956 para 6 em 1984), mas com fortes restrições na sua atuação, que passou a ter rigoroso controle governamental bem como a supressão da representação dos trabalhadores (Cortes, 2002 apud CUNHA, 2013).Além desses conselhos de âmbito nacional, nas décadas de 1970 e 1980 alguns governos municipais criaram conselhos comunitários para mediar suas relações com movimentos e organizações populares, bem como surgiram iniciativas da sociedade civil, que criou conselhos populares que visavam a estabelecer pressão e negociação com o poder público, além do controle sobre recursos e instituições (Gohn, 2001 apud CUNHA, 2013). A área da saúde, por sua vez, desenvolvia experiências de participação comunitária desde 1979, criando comissões interinstitucionais nos três níveis de governo que contavam com a participação de prestadores de serviços privados e representantes de entidades comunitárias, sindicais etc. Essas experiências foram inspiradoras para que a sociedade civil enviasse à Assembleia Constituinte, instituída ao final da ditadura militar e responsável pela formulação de uma nova Constituição (1986-1988), um manifesto que propunha a criação de mecanismos de participação nos municípios do país. O resultado dessa mobilização foi a inscrição do direito à participação direta na Constituição Federal brasileira de 1988 e a previsão constitucional da participação da sociedade na definição e no controle de várias áreas de políticas públicas, como a previdência social, a saúde, a assistência social e a educação. Outras áreas regulamentaram a participação em leis específicas formuladas posteriormente. Em comum a essas áreas está a concretização da participação por meio de conselhos (Michiles, 1989; Teixeira, 2000 apud CUNHA, 2013).A partir dessa regulamentação das áreas de políticas públicas, observou-se uma intensa criação de conselhos no nível municipal, especialmente na década de 1990 (Faria e Coelho, 2010) e a ampliação no nível federal na primeira década do Séc. XXI. Em 2013, contabilizavam-se mais de 40.000 conselhos municipais, sendo que 90% dos municípios brasileiros possuía ao menos 5 conselhos implantados, enquanto no nível federal existiam 36 (Buvinich, 2014).Esses conselhos de políticas públicas diferem significativamente dos seus predecessores em razão: da autonomia da representação (os mandados da sociedade civil não são subordinados ao poder público); da democratização da composição (incluem representantes de diferentes organizações da sociedade civil); da articulação entre participação e representação (os membros da sociedade civil possuem vínculos com associações civis diferenciadas); e da incorporação de práticas características de organizações da sociedade civil (Cunha, 2013). <h3>Participant Selection</h3>Os conselhos são compostos por um número variado de membros (prevalece de 10 a 20 membros) (Faria e Coelho, 2010), que representam segmentos da sociedade e do governo em proporção variada (alguns são paritários entre sociedade e governo, outros pendem mais para a representação da sociedade e outros para a representação governamental) e que possuem envolvimento prévio com a área de política pública, como profissional, usuário, prestador de serviços (públicos e privados), dentre outros. A composição híbrida dos conselhos aponta para processos diferenciados de seleção de participantes – nesse caso, representantes. Os representantes governamentais são indicados pelo próprio governo e correspondem a membros de órgãos públicos responsáveis pela política e outros relacionados à sua gestão. Os representantes da sociedade civil são definidos por diferentes meios, a depender da lei que instituiu o conselho: escolhidos por meio de processos públicos abertos a todos os interessados, indicados por organizações da sociedade civil previamente definidas na lei, indicados pelo governo. No primeiro caso são realizadas eleições, das quais participam organizações da sociedade civil relacionadas com a área da política pública, que são eleitoras previamente cadastradas ao processo eleitoral, bem como possíveis candidatas.  <h3>Deliberation, Decisions, and Public Interaction</h3>Há grande variação quanto aos processos de deliberação, de decisão e de interação com o público nos conselhos. De modo geral, os conselhos se reúnem com alguma regularidade (uma vez ao mês é o que prevalece) para deliberarem e decidirem sobre uma pauta previamente definida. Essa pauta pode ser construída pelo conselho ou por seus dirigentes (presidente e/ou mesa diretora), atendendo a demandas do governo, de organizações da sociedade ou mesmo de cidadãos. Alguns conselhos alteram a pauta durante a reunião, por solicitação de algum membro ou mesmo dos participantes não conselheiros.As reuniões dos conselhos são públicas, abertas à presença de qualquer interessado, sendo que alguns conselhos admitem a vocalização de qualquer participante e outros restringem esse tipo de intervenção, condicionando-a a uma autorização prévia pelos conselheiros. No entanto, só os conselheiros podem tomar decisões. As decisões, de modo geral, são feitas por votação, nas quais se exige maioria simples de votos, sendo que apenas se exige quórum especial (2/3 dos membros) para os casos de alteração do regimento interno (Avritzer, 2010; Pires 2011). As decisões dos conselhos devem ser formalizadas em resoluções às quais se deve dar ampla divulgação, especialmente as que são vinculantes.Há conselhos que possuem uma divisão interna (comissões e/ou grupos de trabalho), que são integradas por parte dos conselheiros, que analisam os temas em pauta previamente às reuniões. Esses subgrupos podem contar com a contribuição de especialistas e de pessoas interessadas para a análise da questão em pauta e para a construção de uma posição mais fundamentada para o debate. Os resultados dessa análise são levados à assembleia e cabe à ela o debate final e a tomada de decisão sobre a questão. A interação dos conselhos com o público pode ocorrer durante as reuniões dos conselhos ou nos interstícios dessas reuniões, por meio de contatos individuais dos conselheiros, de eventos promovidos pela área da política pública, por diferentes mídias (websites, jornais, folders, dentre outros) e, em alguns casos, por meio de conferências de políticas públicas, uma outra instituição participativa que ocorre periódica e regularmente (a cada 2 ou 4 anos, conforme a área) e que reúne milhares de participantes em cada nível de governo em que ocorre – municípios, estados e União.  <h3>Analysis and Lessons Learned</h3>Estudos sobre conselhos de políticas apontam diferentes perspectivas para sua análise, bem como diferentes resultados. As principais conclusões apontam que, de modo geral, os conselhos são espaços abertos ao acolhimento e ao processamento de demandas da sociedade civil e que o desenho institucional é relevante, pois tanto pode compensar desigualdades socioeconômicas e informacionais entre conselheiros e favorecer a democratização dos próprios conselhos, quanto limitar a participação para aqueles que não estão organizados ou associados. Além disso, há diferenças significativas quanto à capacidade de vocalização e de deliberação e os tipos de decisão, que variam conforme a natureza da política e o segmento de origem dos conselheiros. Outro fator que incide na efetividade dos conselhos é a existência de associações e organizações proativas no cenário político, bem como o apoio e a presença efetiva do governante nos processos deliberativos. Quanto à interação com o público, verifica-se que os contatos do conselho com ele informam, mas não determinam as decisões dos conselheiros. Essas conclusões apontam que há limites à efetivação dos conselhos que estão localizados tanto no seu interior quanto no ambiente político-institucional no qual estão inseridos. <h3>Secondary Sources</h3>AVRITZER, Leonardo.

"<p>1st version by Eduardo Moreira da Silva, UFMG, Brazil</p><h3>Definition<img alt="""" src=""http://i.imgur.com/br92J5A.png?3"" /></h3>Os conselhos são orgãos colegiados criados por lei e são compostos por representantes do Estado e da sociedade civil com o propósito de produzir deliberações sobre as diversas áreas de políticas públicas. Os Conselhos de Direitos da Criança e do Adolescente foram previstos pelo Estatuto da Criança e do Adolescente (Lei federal 8.069 de 1990) e receberam a atribuição de formular e monitorar a implementação das políticas públicas destinadas aos adolescentes e às crianças brasileiras. Sendo um órgão deliberativo, o conselho tem a atribuição de elaborar um planejamento anual para a política pública destinada àquele público, nos municípios, nos estados e no governo federal. Os conselhos estão hoje presentes em praticamente todos os municípios brasileiros, pois a legislação atual exige a existência do conselho para que o governo federal possa fazer a transferência de recursos para a implementação das políticas públicas desta área. Deriva desta estratégia o sucesso na criação dos conselhos no país, uma vez que os municípios pretendem receber os recursos dos diversos programas relacionados à área da criança e do adolescente.  <h3>Problems and Purpose</h3> É possível indicar algumas potencialidades dos Conselhos: 1) efeito pedagógico de estímulo à participação dos cidadãos e à democratização da gestão pública; 2) aperfeiçoamento do diálogo entre o Estado e a sociedade; 3) planejamento aprimorado da oferta de serviços públicos; 4) monitoramento das ações e serviços das políticas públicas.  Mas, também, podem-se indicar alguns entraves para seu sucesso: 1) desigualdades entre os participantes, em relação à informação, à qualificação e à assimetria de poder; 2) falta de cultura participativa dos municípios; 3) ausência de compromisso dos gestores públicos com tais espaços; 4) ausência de qualificação da burocracia e reduzida capacidade administrativa.  <h3>History</h3> A Constituição de 1988 foi a grande responsável pela ampla disseminação dos conselhos no sistema político brasileiro. A política destinada às crianças e adolescentes foi considerada prioritária e deveria ser realizada conjuntamente pelo Estado e pela sociedade. Posteriormente, foi publicada a Lei Federal Nº 8.069 de 13 de julho de 1990, que tornou obrigatória a criação dos Conselhos de Direitos da Criança e do Adolescente no governo federal, nos Estados e nos municípios. A mesma lei criou, ainda, os Conselhos Tutelares, que são compostos por indivíduos eleitos pela comunidade para atuar em defesa dos direitos das crianças e adolescentes previstos no Estatuto da Criança e do Adolescente (Lei Federal Nº 8.069 de 13 de julho de 1990).  A maior parte dos conselhos da criança e do adolescente existentes no Brasil foi criada após o ano de 1996. Apesar da legislação que o criou ter sido publicada em 1990, alguns anos se passaram até que a maioria dos municípios tomasse a iniciativa de criar os conselhos. Nos municípios maiores, nos quais é possível encontrar um movimento organizado da sociedade civil em defesa dos direitos da criança e do adolescente, os conselhos tendem a funcionar melhor e a produzir resultados mais expressivos em termos de políticas públicas para as crianças e adolescentes. No entanto, aproximadamente 70% dos municípios brasileiros são pequenas cidades, com até 20 mil habitantes. Nestes locais, a dinâmica de funcionamento dos conselhos pode ser bastante comprometida, pois os prefeitos tendem a indicar para a composição do conselho apenas indivíduos que são fortemente influenciados por ele. Neste caso, se a sociedade civil for pouco participativa e não apresentar a organização e a força suficiente para se contrapor ao poder público, reduz a possibilidade de atuação como agente propositivo de políticas e ações.  <h3>Participant Selection</h3>A seleção dos participantes do conselho (conselheiros) pode ser bem variada de um município para o outro. Mas, em geral, os representantes do poder público são indicados pelo Prefeito e são provenientes de diversas áreas temáticas de políticas públicas, isto é, são representantes da política de assistência social, de saúde, de educação, de esportes e lazer, de cultura etc. Os representantes da sociedade civil podem ser escolhidos em fóruns próprios, organizados e conduzidos pelo próprio conselho, com o propósito de se realizar eleições ou outros processos de escolha das Organizações da Sociedade Civil que irão representar a sociedade nos conselhos. É importante notar que os representantes são sempre membros de Organizações da Sociedade Civil, isto é, trata-se da representação de coletividades e não de indivíduos. Pode haver, ainda, eleições durante as conferências de políticas públicas, que são organizadas a cada dois ou três anos para que a sociedade possa deliberar sobre as diretrizes de políticas públicas para as crianças e adolescentes nos próximos anos. Todos os presentes votam, então, naquelas organizações que irão representar a sociedade civil nos conselhos.  Uma questão extremamente relevante no estudo do funcionamento dos conselhos se refere à ação dos representantes, ou melhor, à representatividade dos conselheiros que tomam assento na instituição, para representar quer o Estado, quer a sociedade.  Na relação do conselheiro com sua entidade, pode-se afirmar que, quanto maior o vínculo que os liga, maior a probabilidade de que diferentes interesses possam fazer-se representados. Os estudos indicam que a representatividade dos conselheiros governamentais apresenta problemas, devido ao frágil vínculo entre os representantes governamentais e seus órgãos de origem. Muitos casos pesquisados indicam que o funcionário enviado pelas agências governamentais nem sempre tem o poder de assumir compromissos em nome dos órgãos que representam. Da mesma forma, quando leva as decisões ao seu local de trabalho, seus superiores podem não acatar as decisões que foram tomadas.  No campo da representação não-governamental, também é possível constatar a fragilidade do vínculo entre os conselheiros e as entidades a que pertencem. Nesse caso, os problemas geralmente mencionados relacionam-se ao preparo dos representantes indicados, pois o exercício da atividade de conselheiro exige certo preparo do representante da instituição, mas não é conveniente que apenas alguns membros da entidade se especializem nesta função, uma vez que este processo tende a distanciá-los das atividades mais gerais da entidade. Por outro lado, não se pode enviar qualquer representante ao conselho, sob pena de que ele não tenha clareza do papel que tem a cumprir. <h3>Deliberation, Decisions, and Public Interaction</h3>O grande desafio presente nos conselhos, enquanto instituições participativas, é construir mecanismos capazes de reduzir os efeitos das desigualdades sociais no interior dos processos decisórios, de forma a permitir que a construção dos acordos não esteja sujeita à influência de fatores como o poder, a riqueza ou as desigualdades sociais preexistentes.  Os conselhos, geralmente, se reúnem uma vez por mês com o propósito de se produzir as decisões relacionadas às políticas destinadas às crianças e adolescentes do município. As reuniões são públicas e abertas à participação da comunidade, que possuem o direito a fazer uso da voz, mas não podem votar. O voto é restrito aos conselheiros, que possuem igualdade no processo decisório e exercem uma função pública não remunerada. As decisões são produzidas pelo coletivo dos conselheiros que interagem publicamente nas reuniões. Estas são orientadas por uma pauta, construída previamente pelos próprios conselheiros, geralmente, na reunião precedente. Em alguns conselhos apenas os membros da mesa diretora podem incluir temas na pauta, mas, geralmente, todos os conselheiros podem sugerir temas e questões para serem incluídas na pauta que será discutida pelos conselheiros. Nos conselhos mais institucionalizados, a pauta de cada reunião é enviada com antecedência para os conselheiros, que podem se preparar previamente para a reunião. Alguns conselheiros realizam uma consulta prévia aos dirigentes de suas organizações de origem e, até mesmo, ao público que eles representam nos conselhos.  <h3>Influence, Outcomes, and Effects</h3>As características dos conselhos podem variar bastante de um município para outro. A literatura tem indicado pelo menos quatro elementos explicam o sucesso ou o fracasso das Instituições Participativas. O primeiro deles é o desenho institucional, que nos permite verificar o grau de inclusividade da instituição, a heterogeneidade da sua composição, a abertura para a participação de atores externos ao conselho, dentre outros. Estes elementos podem favorecer a inclusão e o empoderamento dos participantes presentes naquela instituição, isto é, os conselheiros. O segundo é a tradição associativa local, isto é, a densidade das associações da sociedade civil presentes no município e sua capacidade de promover mobilizações e propor ações para a melhoria das ações voltadas para as crianças e adolescentes. O terceiro aspecto diz respeito às capacidades administrativas e financeiras da gestão municipal para a implementação de políticas destinadas às crianças e aos adolescentes, pois tal característica é fundamental para qualidade das políticas que serão formuladas e implementas no município. O quarto elemento está relacionado ao comprometimento e o respeitos dos gestores municipais em relação às decisões produzidas pelos conselhos. Isto é, importa saber se os gestores públicos conferem poder aos conselhos enquanto arenas deliberativas da política relacionada às crianças e aos adolescentes do município, pois este empoderamento é fundamental para o sucesso do conselho enquanto uma arena realmente deliberativa no município. Os resultados das deliberações produzidas pelos conselhos podem ser bem diversos, mas são mais efetivos quando a combinação daquelas quatro variáveis acima é positiva e o conselho se afirma enquanto uma instituição capaz de influenciar os resultados da política pública.  <h3>Analysis and Lessons Learned</h3>Os conselhos da criança e do adolescente tem o mérito de ampliar a participação dos atores com poder de decisão sobre as políticas públicas destinadas às crianças e adolescentes no Brasil. No entanto, há um conjunto de características que tem dificultado a influência destas instituições sobre os resultados de políticas públicas. A principal delas, possivelmente, é persistência de elevados padrões de desigualdades entre os participantes daquela arena. A análise do perfil dos conselheiros indica que os conselheiros possuem renda e educação bem superior à média da população, o que nos mostra que aqueles indivíduos que possuem níveis inferiores de educação e de renda têm dificuldade de serem incluídos nestas arenas. Tal situação pode reproduzir as desigualdades já existentes.  Outra questão importante é a falta de compromisso de muitos gestores públicos com as decisões provenientes dessas arenas. Em municípios de pequeno porte, principalmente, é bem provável que os prefeitos tenham grande influência sobre a escolha dos conselheiros, o que pode reduzir o empoderamento destas arenas. O bom funcionamento dos conselhos depende muito da infraestrutura a ele fornecida pelo poder público, que está relacionada aos equipamentos e também aos servidores que são responsáveis pela instituição. Há conselhos que não possuem local apropriado para se reunir e nem dispõem de funcionários públicos necessários para o bom funcionamento do órgão. Estes elementos influenciam na capacidade dos conselhos de produzir bons resultados sobre as políticas públicas. A questão estrutural mais relevante no caso dos conselhos da criança e do adolescente é ausência de representantes deste público no conselho, isto é, enquanto em outras áreas de políticas (saúde e assistência social) existem representantes dos usuários das políticas nos conselhos, isto não acontece nos conselhos da criança. Não há crianças e adolescentes atuando como conselheiros, o que significa que são sempre os adultos que os representam. Este deficiência pode comprometer a legitimidade das decisões produzidas pelos conselhos.  ",en,4403,Os conselhos da criança e do adolescente no Brasil

"<p><em>Note: this entry is based on the author's personal experience of speed dialogue. If you think you could make it more robust, please do!</em></p><p><strong>Definition</strong></p><p>Speed dialogue basically involves participants in a participatory process having 3-10 minutes to 'interview' or question a witness or panellist. This might be done in pairs, but usually takes place as part of small group deliberation. Witnesses will spend the same amount of time with each small group and rotate round, like speed-dating. </p><h3>Purpose</h3><p>The ultimate aim of speed dialogue is to enable participants to ask the questions they want to ask, in a focused but relatively informal manner.</p><p>Speed dialogue is best used towards the mid-point of a deliberative process like a citizens' jury or assembly. It is a useful and fun technique for participants to extract the information they want from expert witnesses or panellists. It is best used at the mid-point because participants will likely have begun to identify some key issues they want to find out about, but as yet they have not begun to compile their recommendations or decision yet.</p><p>Speed dialogue may be just one technique of many in a practitioner's toolkit. In a citizens' jury for example, it will likely be one of several methods used throughout the process. However, whole events can be organised around the concept - much like speed-dating. Speed-dialogue events are often about networking or used as a way of bringing different groups of people together. </p><p>Speed dialogue can also be used simply as an icebreaker for groups of most sizes. In its simplest form it just involves turning to your neighbour and introducing yourselves. </p><h3>Influence, Outcomes, and Effects</h3><p>The benefits of speed dialogue during deliberation are that it gives more opportunity for more voices to participate. Not everyone is comfortable asking a question in front of a panel or audience. Speed dialogue is a more intimate atmosphere.</p><p>Because talking time is limited, participants may be able to refine their questioning skills to use the time effectively - there is no time to explore tangents in 3 minutes! Speed dialogue can encourage greater focus from participants. </p><p>Speed dialogue encourages greater participation than the typical Q&A format. Often during a deliberative process, participants get information overload and fatigue. Speed dialogue re-injects some energy into the room and can really bring the issue to life for some participants.</p><p>Speed dialogue gives participants a sense of ownership in a deliberative forum. They no longer have to wait for the chair or facilitator to pick their question. Small groups can pursue issues that maybe others in the room aren't interested in. Speed dialogue is empowering.</p><p>It's fun! Experts being interrogated, running from table to table whilst citizens lean into a tight huddle and hone their next question, facilitators ringing bells to signal time - speed dialogue brings energy and a sense of fun to proceedings.</p><h3>External Links</h3><p>The Dialogue Society have produced a very detailed pamphlet on planning speed dialogue events:</p><p><a href=""http://www.dialoguesociety.org/publications/community/Speed-Dialogue.pdf"">http://www.dialoguesociety.org/publications/community/Speed-Dialogue.pdf</a></p><h3> </h3>",en,4434,Speed Dialogue

Participatory arts, therefore, are forms of artistic expression – through media such as drama, video, and photography – that actively engage participants in the process of making art. This engagement occurs along three main dimensions: (1) production, or the actual “making” of art; (2) decision-making, which determines what type of art is produced, and by and for whom; and (3) consumption (NESF, 2007: 2).

"<p><strong>Definition</strong></p><p>A kitchen table discussion is a small, informal meeting that takes place in someone's home or a local cafe. Kitchen table discussion groups are often used in conjunction with other methods as part of a wider community engagement process, as in<a href=""http://participedia.net/en/cases/protecting-snowies-wild-horse-management-kosciuszko-national-park-0""> Protecting the Snowies</a> engagement in New South Wales, Australia. </p><p>During the meeting, participants discuss issues related to a broader project or topic. They may be provided with a guide or set of questions from interest groups or local governments, but there is no formal agenda for the meeting (NERRA 2016).</p><h3>Purpose</h3><p>The aim of kitchen table conversations is to enable dialogue within the community, that is informal and relaxed. Often the discussion is part of a suite of community engagement tools, and participants can receive a guide to the issue at hand, and possible questions they might want to discuss. The conversation can be about something broad like ""what is important to you?"" to a specific question like ""what methods could be used to control wild horse populations in Kosciuszko National Park?""</p><p>Kitchen table discussions aim to build and deepen a sense of community and explore the range of opinions on an issue. It fosters community organising and can stimulate and nurture public debate: </p><p><em>""A main objective is to give interested parties an opportunity to learn from and share with each other, create a sense of community, and discuss options and alternatives"" </em>(NERRA 2016)</p><h3>Participant Selection</h3><p>Kitchen table discussions are hosted by volunteers who want to take part. In general they are part of a broader engagement process or connected to a particular organisation. Hosts can then invite who they want to join the discussion, generally around eight or nine people (Douglas 2014). It may be a group of friends, acquaintances or family. </p><h3>Deliberation, Decisions, and Public Interaction</h3><p>Hosts of the discussion act as a facilitator, providing participants with any questions or information about the topic. They also lay out the ground rules, ""by reminding everyone that there are no right or wrong ideas, and that everyone's contribution is valuable. The host also encourages people to listen, to ask clarifying questions, and to avoid arguing or interrupting"" (Dept of Sustainability & Environment 2013). One person also volunteers as a scribe.</p><p>The discussion can last up to three hours, with the general idea being that everyone has a chance to share their opinions and be heard. Most guides includes 'starters' - either questions or information to help get the conversation going. </p><h3>Influence, Outcomes, and Effects</h3><p>Kitchen table conversations have been used effectively in Australia to stimulate community engagement. <a href=""http://www.voicesforindi.com/"">Voices for Indi</a>, a community organisation in north-east Victoria has used the kitchen table model to encourage residents to discuss issues relevant to their locale. In total 53 conversations took place with 425 participants. Feedback was provided from the individual meetings and led to the production of a <a href=""http://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/v4i/pages/22/attachments/original/1369543725/V4I_Report.pdf?1369543725"">community report</a> summarising the views represented from the kitchen tables on issues of politics and representation and community concerns. The conversations in Indi aimed to redirect attention and dialogue on the genuine concerns of the electorate - as opposed to the agendas promoted by partisan politicians. Following the campaign, an independent candidate won the seat in Indi. Commentators have suggested that the kitchen table campaign played a role in this (Douglas 2014; Peake 2014).</p><h3>Analysis and Lessons Learned</h3><p>Kitchen table conversations have been championed in various academic fields including political science (Peake 2014), history (Abram 2007), health (Norlander et al 2000) and human geography (Kohl & McCutcheon). </p><p>The kitchen table model has the potential to play a key role in a healthy public sphere, contributing to democratic debate through encouraging dialogue and engagement on important issues. </p><h3>Secondary Sources</h3><p>Abram, R.

"<p><em>The following article is a stub. Please help us complete it.</em></p><h3>Definition</h3><p>Multi-criteria decision analysis is a systematic and rigorous method of analysing and ranking options. It involves considering various solutions to an issue/question/challenge against multiple criteria.</p><h3>Problems and Purpose</h3><p>Multi-criteria decision analysis is not exclusively a method of democratic innovation. However, it has been used in policy formulation within governments (see Gov.uk 2009). <a href=""http://www.21stcenturydialogue.com/"">21st Century Dialogue</a> brought the method to community engagement through the multi-criteria analysis conference, outlined below:</p><p><em>""A Multi Criteria Analysis is a decision-aiding technique to analyse alternatives to complex problems using weighted triple bottom line criteria that are developed by all stakeholders. The end result is the 'best fit' option.</em></p><p><em>The process is systematic, structured, open and accountable. It engages all key stakeholders with their differing objectives. Both technical data and value judgements are used to reach a preference.</em></p><p><em>The MCA process has four key components:</em></p><ol><li><em>A set of alternative options</em></li><li><em>A set of criteria for comparing the alternatives</em></li><li><em>Weighting to attach a measure of importance to each criteria</em></li><li><em>A method of ranking the alternatives based on how well they satisfy the criteria</em></li></ol><p><em>The process involves four key steps:</em></p><ol><li><em>Preparation and involvement of the community from the start;</em></li><li><em>An initial Workshop of all participants to determine the options and criteria;</em></li><li><em>An Expert Panel to oversee the quantitative data and to rate the qualitative data, with both sets of data being input to a specialised software package;</em></li><li><em>A second Workshop of all participants to weight the criteria according to their importance. Using both the quantitative and qualitative data, together with the value judgement weightings, the computer software determines the best options"" </em>(21st Century Dialogue 2011).</li></ol><h3>History</h3><p> </p><h3>Participant Selection</h3><p>There is no specific selection method for MCA but in their WA cases, 21st Century Dialogue employed three methods of recruiting participants with an equal split consisting of: stakeholders, a random sample, and people who responded to public notices of the conference. An MCA forum can have 60-100 participants. </p><p>Central to the process is a panel of technical experts on the issue. The role of participants and experts is deliberately kept separate in the MCA process. Participants (the community) develop the options and criteria for them to be weighted against, whilst the expert panel does the weighting. Hart-Karp (2005, p12) argues that this separation of roles is useful in avoiding conflict during deliberation about the proper place of expert vs. community viewpoints. </p><h3>Deliberation, Decisions, and Public Interaction</h3><p>Multi-criteria decision analysis (MCA) is a way for decision-makers (ctizens or otherwise) to weigh up different options. Usually during deliberation, options are weighed up qualitatively, through discussion. MCA enables the weighing of options to be carried out in a more quantitative, rigorous manner. There are several stages.</p><p>1. The first step is to develop possible options or solutions to the issue at hand. This is done during a one or two day forum with participants from the community and stakeholder groups. During this forum, experts makes presentations and answer questions from participants. Participants then use this information to identify possible policy options or solutions. They also develop a list of criteria against which the options will be weighted. The task is to simply define criteria because all options and criteria will be put forward. </p><p>2. Following the forum, an expert panel meets and deliberates in order to weight the options against the criteria. Ultimately, the task of the panel is consider the relative impact of each option with relation to different criteria. For example, during WA's freight network review, 21 possible options and 39 criteria were defined. These criteria were derived from the 'triple bottom line' criteria of economic, social and environmental impacts. Thus the role of the expert panel was to consider the impact of each option on each criterion and give it a numerical score. During this time, the panel are provided with any additional technical information that they require. The process can take several weeks to a few months depending on the complexity and number of options/criteria. </p><p>3. When the expert panel have completed their analysis, a second forum is convened. The same participants from the first forum are invited to attend. During this session, participants review the decisions of the expert panel. Their task here is give different weighting to the criteria ie. rank the criteria in order of importance. Although deliberation in small groups take place, participants individually decide how much weight to give to each criteria.</p><p>4. The ultimate decision is made through computer analysis, once all the relevant information including the options and their relative weighting against the criteria, plus the weighting of criteria, have been fed into the computer. The final option presented is a 'best-fit option' (21st Century Dialogue 2011). The results are calculated and immediately shown to the forum participants to reflect upon. </p><h3>Influence, Outcomes, and Effects</h3><p> </p><h3>Analysis and Lessons Learned</h3><p>The benefits of using MCA are the separation of roles of experts and community participants, and the facilitation of a rigorous, systematic decision-making process. It may be particularly useful for a complex issue where the weighing of options qualitatively may be more difficult. </p><p>However, there are some limitations and challenges to consider. 21st Century Dialogue note that in cases - although participants accepted the final decision of the MCA - they also expressed frustration or dissatisfaction with the outcome. In the <a href=""http://participedia.net/en/cases/albany-administration-centre-site-citizens-jury"">Albany Citizens' Jury</a>, Hartz-Karp (2007, p11) notes that some participants felt that others had not been completely honest in their individual weightings, ""biasing the final results in the direction they had preferred at the outset"". This illustrates the disadvantage of private/individual choices vs. open collective deliberation to make decisions. The private element of the MCA resulted in a loss of trust between participants and ultimately, a lack of confidence in the final outcome. In the <a href=""http://www.21stcenturydialogue.com/index.php?package=Initiatives&action=Link&file=east_west_route_to_freo_port.html"">freight network MCA</a>, although the outcome was accepted by participants, it was not widely accepted in the community and the issue continued to be a contentious and political issue.</p><p>MCA can also become a very labour and time intensive option. In the <a href=""http://participedia.net/en/cases/western-australias-freight-network-review"">freight network review </a>MCA, the extent of options and criteria submitted meant that the expert panel required additional time and resources to carry out their task. On the other hand, another MCA conference in WA on haulage routes yielded just two possible options for consideration, reducing the complexity and workload for the expert panel.</p><h3>Secondary Sources</h3><p>21st Century Dialogue (2011) <em>East-West Freight Route</em> [online], available at: <a href=""http://www.21stcenturydialogue.com/index.php?package=Initiatives&action=Link&file=east_west_route_to_freo_port.html"">http://www.21stcenturydialogue.com/index.php?package=Initiatives&action=...</a></p><p>Gov.uk (2009) <em>Multi-criteria analysis: a manual</em> [pdf], Department for communities and local government, available at: <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/7612/1132618.pdf"">https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/fil...</a></p><p>Hartz-Karp, J.
